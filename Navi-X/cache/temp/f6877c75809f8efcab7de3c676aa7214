description=The Duke Family---Cousins Bo and Luke, assisted by their cousin Daisy and their Uncle Jesse, fight the system and root out the corrupt practices of Hazzard County Commissioner Boss Hogg and his bumbling Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane. The show became an instant hit, never failing to win its time slot during its original run on CBS for seven seasons from 1979-1985. The Duke boys, a pair of 'Robin Hood' types complete with flaming bows and arrows, are assisted in their adventures by their car, an orange 1969 Dodge Charger named 'The General Lee.' "The Dukes of Hazzard" is set in Georgia, and the show's southern influence is felt throughout. Country singing superstar Waylon Jennings performed the famous theme song to the show ("Good Ol' Boys"), and acts as 'The Balladeer,' narrating the adventures of each episode.

description=Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972),[1] better known by his stage name Eminem, is an American rapper, record producer, and actor. Eminem quickly gained popularity in 1999 with his major-label debut album, The Slim Shady LP, which won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. The following album, The Marshall Mathers LP, became the fastest-selling solo album in United States history.[2] It brought Eminem increased popularity, including his own record label, Shady Records, and brought his group project, D12, to mainstream recognition.

The Marshall Mathers LP and his third album, The Eminem Show, also won Grammy Awards, making Eminem the first artist to win Best Rap Album for three consecutive LPs. He then won the award again in 2010 for his album Relapse, giving him a total of 11 Grammys in his career. In 2003, he won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for "Lose Yourself" from the film, 8 Mile, in which he also played the lead. "Lose Yourself" would go on to become the longest running No. 1 hip hop single.[3] Eminem then went on hiatus after touring in 2005. He released his first album since 2004's Encore, titled Relapse, on May 15, 2009. Eminem is the best-selling artist of the decade on the US Nielsen SoundScan,[4] and has sold more than 80 million albums worldwide to date, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world.[5] In 2010, Eminem released his seventh studio album Recovery. It became Eminem's sixth consecutive number-one album in the US and achieved international commercial success, charting at number one in several other countries. It stayed at number-one on the US Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks and a total of seven weeks.[6][7] Recovery was also reported by Billboard to be the best-selling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history to have two year-end best-selling albums.[8]

Eminem was ranked 79th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time.[9] He was also ranked 82nd on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[10] He was also named the Best Rapper Alive by Vibe magazine in 2008.[11] Including his work with D12, Eminem has achieved nine No. 1 albums on the Billboard Top 200, 7 solo (6 studio albums, 1 compilation) and 2 with D12.[12] Eminem has had 13 number one singles worldwide. In December 2009, Eminem was named the Artist of the Decade by Billboard magazine.[13] His albums The Eminem Show, The Marshall Mathers LP, and Encore (in order) ranked as the 3rd,[14] 7th,[14] and 40th[15] best-selling albums of the 2000ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃ¢ÂÂÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ÃÂÃÂÃ¢ÂÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃ¯Â¿Â½ÃÂÃÂ2009 decade by Billboard magazine. Also according to Billboard, Eminem has two of his albums among the top five highest selling albums of the 2000s. In the UK, Eminem has sold over 12.5 million records.[16] Eminem has also sold more than 33 million track downloads and 39.6 million albums in the United States alone.[17] In 2010, MTV ranked Eminem as the 7th biggest icon in pop music history.[18] During 2010, Eminem's music generated 94 million streams, more than any other music artist.[17]
