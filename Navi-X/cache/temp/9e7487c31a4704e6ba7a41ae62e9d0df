description=The quiet town of Delmar, New York, was considered anything but dangerous...until 21-year-old Chris Porco was accused of brutally murdering his father Peter and disfiguring his mother Joan in a savage axe attack, a claim made all the more shocking when the case's lead detective Joe Sullivan believed Joan had identified Chris as her attacker. Weeks after the crime, however, Joan would refute Detective Sullivan's story, while the town of Delmar and many of Chris' former friends and girlfriends would also rally to his defense, despite Sullivan's fierce mission to prove his guilt. Prosecutors believed that beneath Chris' picture-perfect faÃ§ade was a devious and cunning sociopath who would stop at nothing to keep his lies hidden. In the end, he was convicted of second-degree murder of his father, but many in the town of Delmar firmly believe the jury wrongfully convicted an innocent young man./description

description=In early afternoon, four armed men hijack a subway train in Manhattan. They stop on a slight incline, decoupling the first car to let the rest of the train coast back. Their leader is Ryder; he connects by phone with Walter Garber, the dispatcher watching that line. Garber is a supervisor temporarily demoted while being investigated for bribery. Ryder demands $10 million within an hour, or he'll start shooting hostages. He'll deal only with Garber. The mayor okays the payoff, the news of the hostage situation sends the stock market tumbling, and it's unclear what Ryder really wants or if Garber is part of the deal. Will hostages, kidnappers, and negotiators live through this?/description

description=Seventy-five percent of the American people still refuse to believe the official story of President John F. Kennedy's death. They do not think he was killed by a lone gunman but by a mysterious cabal that somehow conspired to have him killed. How can this be? How can a crime this famous, witnessed and investigated by so many, remain a mystery? This is what veteran Australian police detective Colin McLaren is determined to find out. JFK: The Smoking Gun follows the forensic cold-case investigation McLaren conducted over four painstaking years, taking us back to that tragic day in Dallas at Dealey Plaza where the shooting took place, to Parkland Hospital where the president was pronounced dead, to the Bethesda Naval Hospital where the autopsy was conducted and to the conclusions of the Warren Commission that have remained controversial to this day. Driven by a seasoned police detective who, thanks to modern technology, finally had access to all the facts and to witness testimony, the documentary uses logic, reason and time-tested investigative techniques to solve a crime that is every bit as shocking and incredible today as it was when it first happened 50 years ago. Colin McLaren believes he has found "the smoking gun" that killed JFK. Once you've seen this film, he's confident you will believe it, too./description

But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has the world at his feet-or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better.../description

Chaos ensues as old scores are settled in the unlikeliest of settings in this darkly funny film by Luc Besson (Taken, Transporter)./description

description=Set in the most depressing corner of a postapocalyptic future, our heroine Kantmiss Evershot (Maiara Walsh) volunteers to take her manipulative younger sister's place in the seventy-fifth annual "Starving Games." In doing so, she must leave behind her smoldering just-a-friend Dale (Brant Daugherty) and team up with the geeky baker's son Peter Malarkey (Cody Allen Christian) in a fight for her life. But wait, there's more! She could also win an old ham, a coupon for a foot-long sub at a six-inch price, and a partially eaten pickle! In The Starving Games, Friedberg and Seltzer's sixth cinematic spoof of box-office hits, the prolific parody duo has its sights trained on the adventure blockbuster The Hunger Games! It's all the laughs and half the calories as they sling dozens of cock-eyed, barbed arrows at sci-fi, action and fantasy films from The Avengers and Oz the Great and Powerful to pop culture characters and celebrities like Harry Potter and Taylor Swift./description

description=In March 1963, a black mass was held at a ruined church in Clophill, Bedfordshire by a coven of dark witches. Tombs were looted, animals sacrificed and human bones arranged during a macabre ceremony. Further defilements continued at Clophill in the following years, with cattle in nearby fields found mutilated, evidence of necromancy discovered and perpetual sightings of paranormal activity witnessed at the isolated ruin. 50 years on from the original incident, the Clophill legend remains etched on the psyches of the local populace. In 2010, a documentary team was assembled to investigate the legend of the Clophill witches and to try and uncover the truth behind the paranormal events. What followed during that long weekend at Clophill was a terrifying journey into the unknown./description

description=Martin Bonner has just moved to Nevada from the East Coast, leaving behind his two adult children and a life he spent more than two decades building. He's there working a new job as the volunteer coordinator for a non-profit organization that helps prisoners make the transition from incarceration to freedom. It's Martin's first job in two years and he's recently declared bankruptcy. At the same time, Travis Holloway, a prisoner in the program, is being released after serving twelve years. Sent back into the world with nothing, Travis also finds life in Reno difficult to adjust to, despite the help from his program sponsor, Steve Helms. The stories of Martin and Travis slowly converge, as the two men meet and find that they have much in common, not the least of which is an unspoken need for encouragement and support. Their unlikely friendship blossoms but is put to the test when Travis betrays Martin's trust in order to reunite with his estranged daughter./description

description=The manager of England's national football unexpectedly succumbs to a heart attack, and suddenly the search is on for a replacement. Most people who seem qualified for the position have the good sense to turn it down, and so the responsibility falls to Mike Bassett, a scruffy and loud-mouthed lout whose claim to football fame is leading a previously undistinguished team to a league championship. Bassett insists that England will win the World Cup under his leadership, but that's before he replaces his star player with a once-gifted footballer who has since developed a drinking problem, and hired a one-time car salesman as his assistant. After stunning losses to Poland and Belgium, Bassett goes from a favorite of both fans and the press to one of the most hated men in England; hoping to whip his team into shape, he subjects them to the high-tech training methods of eccentric Dr. Shoegaarten, which injures more players than it helps. Despite Bassett's ineptitude, England manages to qualify for the World Cup tournament thanks to group opponents Turkey losing their final game, and he flies to Rio with his team in hopes of somehow turning their bad luck around./description

description=When legions of monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse./description

description=September 24 1988. 25 year anniversary of the famous race.
 In the history of the Olympics, there's never been a controversy quite like what ensued over the 100 meter race at Seoul in 1988. The match brought together Carl Lewis (USA) and Ben Johnson (Canada) who had been fierce competitors. Lewis was known as a savvy careerist who became an American hero at the previous Los Angeles Olympics. Johnson was his chief rival, considered an underdog due to his recovery from a pulled hamstring. In less than 10 seconds, Johnson edged out in front of Lewis to win the Seoul race. But that wasn't the end. Three days later, in a reversal of fortune, the Olympic committee announced that Johnson had failed a drug test, losing his medal to Lewis in disgrace. A mystery still shrouds the race. Was Johnson exceptional in his drug usage or merely the fall guy for a widespread practice? Six of the eight finalists in the 1988 race have since been implicated for drugs -- although some still deny any wrongdoing. Filmmaker Daniel Gordon, digs into the controversy, conducting extensive interviews with Lewis and Johnson as well as their competitors, coaches and Olympic insiders. He uncovers layers of intrigue, deception and favoritism that change our perception of the way this story has previously been told.

The Seoul race wound up being the world's wake-up call to drugs in sports. Now the problem runs rampant throughout professional and amateur athletics. As drug-testing gets more sophisticated, so do means of evading it. This powerful story forces us to question what we expect from our athletes as they pursue records in the name of national pride. This story from the past is vital to understanding the future of sports. 
Some say even today that the americans were so jeolous of Ben Johnson and Canada that Ben Johnson's drink was tampered with during the drug testing at Seoul. You be the judge./description

Also, " Adult Contemporary" is well represented by International Pop star Matt Monroe who sings "Walk Away" and "For Mama". Concert footage of "The Beatles" is included to "open and close the show". They are seen performing "She Loves You" and "Twist And Shout". Among the many recording acts we see "The Animals" sing "The House Of The Rising Sun" and "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood", Billy J Kramer and The Dakotas" perform "Little Children", "The Rockin' Berries" do an excellent cover of " The Token's" earlier recording of "He's In Town","The Honeycombs", featuring female drummer Honey Lantree, perform "Have I The Right" and "Eyes" and "Herman's Hermits" perform their breakthrough hit, "I'm Into Something Good". In two "back to back" rocking performances we see Billie Davis sing "What You Gonna Do" and "The Spencer Davis Group", with Stevie Winwood, "get down" with "My Babe". As with "The Tami Show", there are some bright dance segments, which is probably why the original US title in 1965 was "Go Go Mania"./description

description=The first true rock and roll feature film, Rock Around the Clock is a highly fictionalized account of the discovery of rock and roll by small-time promoter Steve Hollis, when Hollis visits a small town to find Bill Haley and the Comets packing in the crowds. Hollis also finds time for romance with teenage dancer Lisa. The main purpose of the film was to introduce Haley to a worldwide film audience. The band was joined by fellow rockers Freddie Bell and the Bellboys along with The Platters for this early rock musical. This film was banned in many countries after reports of teenagers ripping up the seats in their excitement over the loud, raucous music on the soundtrack, though today the film is more likely to spur nostalgia./description

description=18+ Parental Discretion Advised\nAdult cinema director Russ Meyer returns to the screen for his first time in 20 years with this documentary about big-breasted (Triple H cup) strip dancer Pandora Peaks. Meyer combines biographical info on the chesty exhibitionist with plenty of Peaks' sexy routines, as well as snippets of his own cinematic history. Reminiscent of the director's earlier Mondo Topless, the film is a collision of rapidly moving montage sequences that supply acres of skin along with Meyer's own lecherous sense of humor. The pneumatic Peaks is shown dancing in dusty desert locales, drinking at a German Oktoberfest, and enjoying a stimulating workout on her Trimax machine. Meyer is also a frequent face, trout fishing with a variety of Army buddies and mugging impishly at his over-endowed subject. The film includes appearances from busty starlets such as Tundi, Leosha, and Candy Samples and brings back Anthony James Ryan to briefly reprise his role from Eve and the Handyman. ~ Fred Beldin, Rovi/description

description=It's 1962. Fifty-nine year old Joe Valachi is convicted for drug trafficking and imprisoned. Inside, someone is out to kill him. He learns that it is his mob boss, Don Vito Genovese, who is in the same penitentiary as him, since Genovese mistakenly believes he was the snitch who put him behind bars. Because of the bounty on his head from his own, a federal agent named Ryan convinces Valachi really to be a mob informant in return for safety inside. Valachi tells a story that starts in 1929, when he was first imprisoned in Sing Sing and met Tony Bender, who introduced him into the life of the mob. Through internal struggles for control of the mob, Valachi remained faithful to the mob family, including through Genovese's reign starting in the late 1930s. As Valachi nears the end of his story, he learns that what has happened in the time leading up to and during his latest incarceration was by no accident, which is all the more troubling to him if only for the safety of his family including his wife Maria, the daughter of a mobster, who he was only able to marry through assistance by Genovese./description
