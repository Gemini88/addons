Oh, Stewie, how exciting!

11
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:38,598
Your first visit to a real fire station!

12
00:00:38,598 --> 00:00:41,698
Yeah, you kids always loved your first trip to the fire station.

13
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:43,198
You remember when we took Meg?

14
00:00:47, 31 --> 00:00:49,531
Welcome to the Quahog Fire Department, folks.

15
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:51, 64
I'm Captain Beckman.

16
00:00:51, 64 --> 00:00:52,231
Let me know if you have any questions

17
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,398
that I can answer for you.

18
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:54,698
JOE: What's up, nerds?

19
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:58,131
You waiting for some guy to fall asleep with a cigarette?

20
00:00:58,131 --> 00:00:59,531
Lazy fire turds!

21
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:01,264
Have another donut, pig!

22
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:03,331
We got guns! You got hoses!

23
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,198
See you on the softball field!

24
00:01:10,398 --> 00:01:13,431
Over here is our kitchen, where we make all our meals.

25
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:15,364
And upstairs is where we sleep.

26
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:17,164
What about your wives and families?

27
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:19,664
Sometimes we don't see them for long periods of time.

28
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:21,598
Well, that sounds awfully lonely.

29
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:24,164
Like being an NBA player on the road.

30
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:26,264
Baby, I miss my wife so much.

31
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:28, 98
Thanks for understanding that we can't do anything.

32
00:01:28, 98 --> 00:01:29,298
I just want to cuddle.

33
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,698
Oh, you're so sweet.

34
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:32,464
I'm just doing what a man should do.

35
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:35,198
Respecting the sacred institution of marriage.

36
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:37,264
And now, straight to sleep.

37
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,664
ANNOUNCER:  This message brought  to you by the NBA.

38
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,331
Let's all pretend this happens.

39
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:44, 31
Hey, Chris, you think it's safe to drink from a fire hose?

40
00:01:44, 31 --> 00:01:45,598
Why not, Dad? It's just water.

41
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:47,598
All right, well, turn it on. I'm very thirsty.

42
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:51,431
Nice job, Chris.

43
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:52,764
You got my shirt wet.

44
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,331
Now, few people realize

45
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:57,131
that until 1928 there were no hoses,

46
00:01:57,131 --> 00:02:00, 98
and you actually had to fight fires with your bare hands.

47
00:02:00, 98 --> 00:02:02,164
I will now give a demonstration.

48
00:02:07, 64 --> 00:02:08, 64
(grunts)

49
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,331
Whoa, scrappy little blaze, huh?

50
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,331
Oh, my God, the fire's got a gun!

51
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:19, 98
What the (bleep) was that?

52
00:02:19, 98 --> 00:02:21, 98
(making driving noises)

53
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:23,631
Come on, Stewie. We're going.

54
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:25, 64
Just a moment, Brian.

55
00:02:25, 64 --> 00:02:26,398
I'm pretending I'm a fireman.

56
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:28, 98
I love playing pretend.

57
00:02:28, 98 --> 00:02:30,598
My name's Peter and I work in the brewery.

58
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:32,231
Now I'm gonna put on my pants

59
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:33,598
and go talk to my coworkers at...

60
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:35,331
These pants have stool in them.

61
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:42,364
Well, I hope everyone had a fun afternoon at the firehouse.

62
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:43,998
I sure did, Mom!

63
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:47,164
I can't wait for the next family outing!

64
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:50,498
Aw, thanks, Mike.

65
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:52,131
I hate fire stations.

66
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,131
(man's voice): No problem, man. (sniffing)

67
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:56,231
Is that alcohol on your breath?

68
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:57,264
Yeah, maybe.

69
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:59,764
You're playing this too fast and loose, Mike!

70
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:05,631
Ooh, ooh, is that the mail?

71
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:07,298
Yeah. Is there anything in there for me?

72
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:08,698
I want to see if there's a response

73
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:10,364
to all those fan letters I've been writing.

74
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,398
PETER:  Dear Cary Elwes,

75
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:15,331
I have been meaning to  contact you for some time.

76
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:18,398
I have never been able to  figure out if you are famous.

77
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,298
You were a big deal  in one thing,

78
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:23,131
but you were wearing  a mask for most of it.

79
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:25,431
Do you consider your  career a disappointment?

80
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:28,331
Or rather, did you exceed  your own expectations?

81
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,598
Yours truly, Peter Griffin.

82
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:34, 98
P.S. You were in Robin Hood: Men in Tights.

83
00:03:34, 98 --> 00:03:35,764
Did you know that?

84
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:38, 98
Hey, there's something here from the Nielsen Company.

85
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,598
"Dear Griffin family,

86
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:43,464
"You have been specially selected from amongst millions

87
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:46,364
"of American households to be a Nielsen family,

88
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:50,198
"and as such, to have your TV viewing habits monitored

89
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:53,131
in order to measure television ratings."

90
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:56,398
Oh, kids, this came all the way from Delaware.

91
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:57,631
What does all that mean?

92
00:03:57,631 --> 00:04:00,264
Well, Meg, it sounds like they want us to be part of

93
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:02,464
a select group of people that helps determine what's on TV.

94
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:04,131
We're gonna be a Nielsen family?

95
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,131
That's awesome!

96
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:07,131
(somber, sad music plays)

97
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:10, 98
I think... uh...

98
00:04:10, 98 --> 00:04:11,764
I think that's the wrong music.

99
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:14,364
(victorious fanfare plays)

100
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:16, 98
There you go.

101
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:26,431
Now, this Nielsen box will keep track of everything you watch,

102
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,564
which helps us generalize the viewing habits

103
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:30,331
of millions of Americans.

104
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:31,564
Ah, yes.

105
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,631
And what was that beginning, middle and end part again?

106
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,198
Um...

107
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:38,264
this Nielsen box will keep track of everything you watch,

108
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:40,364
which helps us generalize the viewing habits

109
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42, 64
of millions of Americans.

110
00:04:42, 64 --> 00:04:44,164
Is there any way you can describe that to me

111
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:46, 83
using colorful puppets of some sort?

112
00:04:48, 83 --> 00:04:51,617
The Nielsen box will monitor your viewing habits!

113
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:52,950
(scratchy laugh)

114
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,383
I don't like the left puppet. His chin is scary.

115
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,883
Well, thanks for your cooperation.

116
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02, 50
If you have any questions, please call me.

117
00:05:02, 50 --> 00:05:03,983
And welcome to the Nielsen family.

118
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:06,383
Thank you very much.

119
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:08, 50
Well, isn't this exciting.

120
00:05:08, 50 --> 00:05:10, 17
I know, I can't believe we're a Nielsen family!

121
00:05:10, 17 --> 00:05:11,883
I never get picked for anything.

122
00:05:16, 17 --> 00:05:18, 17
(people screaming)

123
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:29,783
All right, everyone.

124
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:31,150
Time to do our Nielsen duty.

125
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,683
So, what are we gonna watch?

126
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:33,917
Boobs!  Project Runway!

127
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,150
The Good Wife! That black version of our show!

128
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,183
You know, guys, this is a real opportunity

129
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:39,883
to promote quality programming.

130
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:41, 83
I think we should watch PBS.

131
00:05:41, 83 --> 00:05:43, 83
Yeah, you're real passionate about PBS.

132
00:05:43, 83 --> 00:05:46,217
You donated once five years ago and they sent you a mug.

133
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:48,917
And now the mug's so old that the "P" has been worn off

134
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50, 50
so it just says "B.S."

135
00:05:50, 50 --> 00:05:52,917
It's libtards like you that are screwing up our country.

136
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,750
(knock at door)

137
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,750
Tom Tucker? What are you doing here?

138
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,217
Well, I heard you're the new Nielsen family.

139
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:01,683
Just hoping you plan to watch the Channel Five News.

140
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:03,283
I don't know. I've missed so many.

141
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:04,917
It's gonna take me forever to catch up.

142
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:07, 50
Well, we'd sure love to have you as a viewer.

143
00:06:07, 50 --> 00:06:08, 83
Is there anything we can do

144
00:06:08, 83 --> 00:06:10,783
to make the news more appealing to you? Maybe.

145
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:12,317
I guess you could lose the moustache.

146
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:13,717
Lose my moustache?

147
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,717
Well, gosh, I... I don't know.

148
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:17, 17
My birthmark makes it kind of tough.

149
00:06:17, 17 --> 00:06:19,383
Always caused me problems at my old job.

150
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:22, 17
And that'll do it for us here at Channel 12 News.

151
00:06:22, 17 --> 00:06:23,617
Make sure you turn those clocks ahead.

152
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,950
Good night, St. Louis.

153
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,950
Yeah, I don't know,

154
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,883
I was never that crazy about the moustache.

155
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:29,917
Well, I suppose I could lose it and just use more makeup.

156
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,317
Yeah, that'd be cool.

157
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:33,850
And maybe a festive hat would make things more festive.

158
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,950
All right, this is good. Any other suggestions?

159
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,283
Yeah, can you end each show

160
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:39,983
by trying to pull-start a very cold chain saw?

161
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41, 50
Well, that shouldn't be a problem.

162
00:06:41, 50 --> 00:06:42,783
All right, thank you for being so candid.

163
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:44, 50
Hey, thanks for listening.

164
00:06:44, 50 --> 00:06:45,917
I know how hard it is to take criticism.

165
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,350
Hey, nice boots, Griffin.

166
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,783
They sell men's shoes where you got those?

167
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:52,717
PETER:  You made a commitment  to these boots, Peter.

168
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:54,150
These boots are the new you,

169
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,683
and no one will shake that.

170
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:58,283
Yee-haw, ride 'em, cowgirl!

171
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:00, 83
PETER:  Okay, you can take  the boots off at lunch.

172
00:07:00, 83 --> 00:07:02, 17
Go to the gym.  Have a workout.

173
00:07:02, 17 --> 00:07:03,317
Come back in your sneakers.

174
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:05,383
If anyone asks, you forgot  the boots in your locker.

175
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07, 17
Just make it to lunch.

176
00:07:07, 17 --> 00:07:08,883
Those boots are made for walkin'.

177
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:10,217
Up to guys' butts.

178
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:12,383
(laughing)

179
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,150
Hey, fellas. Hey.

180
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,917
TOM TUCKER: Good evening, Quahog.

181
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:20,817
Tonight, Channel Five mourns the loss

182
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:21,917
of a dear colleague.

183
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,383
My moustache.

184
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:25,883
And as per the wishes of my moustache,

185
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:28,217
his ashes were sprinkled off the coast of Acapulco

186
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:29,383
where he was born.

187
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31, 50
Well, that'll do it for us here.

188
00:07:31, 50 --> 00:07:32,383
Thanks for watching Channel Five,

189
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:34,383
the most trusted name in news.

190
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:39, 17
Ah, crap.

191
00:07:39, 17 --> 00:07:41, 17
Oh, come on.

192
00:07:43, 50 --> 00:07:45, 50
Let's go, Tom.

193
00:07:45, 50 --> 00:07:46,817
Work, damn it!

194
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:47,883
What the hell?

195
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49, 17
What's going on with the news?

196
00:07:49, 17 --> 00:07:51,217
This is terrible! Yeah, has he lost his mind?

197
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:52,850
Well, I'll be damned.

198
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55, 50
If I knew he was gonna do all that stuff I told him,

199
00:07:55, 50 --> 00:07:56,183
I would've told him more stuff.

200
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:57,383
What?

201
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:59,383
Peter, you told him to do this crap?

202
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:00,983
Yeah, he came to my house when he found out

203
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03, 50
I was a Nielsen family, asked what I wanted to see.

204
00:08:03, 50 --> 00:08:04,817
Hey, hey, you know what would be cool?

205
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,950
If he did the news with a family of prairie dogs,

206
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,783
and whenever he said something sad,

207
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:10,883
they'd pop their heads up, all concerned.

208
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,383
Peter, you sure that's such a good idea?

209
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:14,817
People rely on the local news to provide them with

210
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,617
several stories a year on how saltwater taffy is made.

211
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,350
Yeah, if you're a Nielsen family,

212
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,283
it seems like you should maybe be

213
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:22,983
a little more thoughtful with your choices.

214
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:23,950
What are you talking about?

215
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,183
I'm just having a little fun.

216
00:08:25,183 --> 00:08:26,850
For God's sakes, I've just been handed

217
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,317
the coolest freaking toy on the planet.

218
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:31,850
Well, you know, except for Hungry Hungry Alec Baldwins.

219
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:36,250
Hey, I'm not... I'm not even touching the lever.

220
00:08:41, 50 --> 00:08:43,783
Chilling news from Long Island Sound,

221
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:46, 50
as a four-passenger prop plane on its way to East Hampton

222
00:08:46, 50 --> 00:08:47,883
spun into the surf off Montauk Point.

223
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:51,117
There were no survivors.

224
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:53,817
Oh, that's so great, I just called him on the way home!

225
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:56,183
Peter, I'm not sure this is entirely responsible.

226
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,717
I don't see what the big deal is.

227
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:59,117
I was just trying to make the show better.

228
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:01, 83
Hell, I wish I could do it with all the shows.

229
00:09:01, 83 --> 00:09:03, 17
Yeah, well, you only have one Nielsen box.

230
00:09:03, 17 --> 00:09:04,783
You don't have the clout to affect national shows.

231
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:06, 17
Damn it.

232
00:09:06, 17 --> 00:09:07,217
I guess that means I'll never get to see

233
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:09,250
an episode of  Superman where Clark Kent and Lois Lane

234
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11, 17
finally get together.

235
00:09:11, 17 --> 00:09:12,117
Lois, I love you,

236
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:15,383
and I want there to be no more secrets between us.

237
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:17, 50
I am Superman.

238
00:09:17, 50 --> 00:09:18,383
Oh, my God.

239
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:20,250
The only thing that can kill me is kryptonite.

240
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,983
Or latex.

241
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:22,950
Or lambskin.

242
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,883
What about polyurethane? All that.

243
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:25,883
All that stuff.

244
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:27,883
(knock at door)

245
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:28,983
Hi, folks.

246
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:31, 50
Just thought I'd stop by and make sure your equipment

247
00:09:31, 50 --> 00:09:33,183
is working properly and see if you have any questions.

248
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35, 50
Yeah, is something wrong with our remote?

249
00:09:35, 50 --> 00:09:36,817
No matter how low I turn the volume,

250
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:38,817
Aziz Ansari is always shouting at me.

251
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:40,283
What did I do?

252
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:42, 83
Thank you. I think we're good.

253
00:09:42, 83 --> 00:09:43,783
Everything seems to be going well.

254
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,850
Okay, great.

255
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,183
Well, I'm just gonna change out the card

256
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:48,650
on your unit real quick and I'll be on my way.

257
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:01,950
Well, we're all set.

258
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,983
Thanks for your time.

259
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:04,150
No, thank you, pal.

260
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,717
And hey, you've been working hard.

261
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,183
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?

262
00:10:07,183 --> 00:10:09,717
Here's two tickets to Sandra Bernhard's one-woman show.

263
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:10,917
Wow, thanks!

264
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:11,883
Yeah, and they're great seats.

265
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,250
They're right in the gap of her teeth.

266
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15, 17
Social media?

267
00:10:15, 17 --> 00:10:16,683
More like a social disease.

268
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:17,683
(audience laughs)

269
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,617
Ha! That's funny!

270
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,983
Peter, what the hell's going on here?

271
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:28,217
Lois, we're no longer one Nielsen family.

272
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:30,117
We're 100.

273
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:31,650
More boxes, more power.

274
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,250
And I got some ideas to make TV better.

275
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:36,617
(phone rings)

276
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:38,250
Hello,  Mad Men production office.

277
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,383
Yeah, Peter Griffin here.

278
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:40,883
Could I speak with Jon Hamm, please?

279
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,150
One moment.

280
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,150
(phone rings)

281
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45, 17
Hello? Hello, Jon Hamm?

282
00:10:45, 17 --> 00:10:46, 83
Peter Griffin, Nielsen family.

283
00:10:46, 83 --> 00:10:47,817
Listen, did I catch you at a good time,

284
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:50,117
or are you and the critics busy sucking each other's butts?

285
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,250
Excuse me?

286
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,950
Look, your show is really boring.

287
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54, 50
But don't worry, I got some ideas

288
00:10:54, 50 --> 00:10:55,183
on how you can jazz it up.

289
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:57, 17
Listen, I don't need your suggestions, pal.

290
00:10:57, 17 --> 00:10:59,817
I've been a big celebrity for a year and a half now.

291
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,250
Okay, if that's how you're gonna be.

292
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03, 50
We'll see how this plays out.

293
00:11:03, 50 --> 00:11:05,117
Lois, we're not watching  Mad Men no more.

294
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:09,850
(phone ringing)

295
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,850
Hello?

296
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,250
Look, I may have been a little rash.

297
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,917
Our ratings have dropped 50%.

298
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,983
Whatever suggestions you have, I'll listen.

299
00:11:18, 83 --> 00:11:19,683
And so, gentlemen, in baseball,

300
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:21,817
three strikes and you're out.

301
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:23,617
But three Lucky Strikes...

302
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,750
and you're in.

303
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,950
Nice try, Don.

304
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,183
But I'm afraid we're going to have

305
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:29,717
to take our business elsewhere.

306
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:31,817
Oh? I don't think so.

307
00:11:35, 17 --> 00:11:37,683
(playing  Star Wars theme)

308
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,883
What the hell was that?

309
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:44,150
I'll tell you what it was, Lois.

310
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,317
It was awesome.

311
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:46,983
And wait'll you see  Breaking Bad.

312
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:49,650
I don't know what it was, but now it's on roller skates.

313
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,817
Hi, NBC, this is Peter Griffin.

314
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:55,717
Listen, you guys are doing a great job.

315
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:59,283
If anybody knows what America wants in the '90s, it's NBC.

316
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,283
But I just have one small request:

317
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:04,283
I like  Dateline, but I really hate waiting two hours

318
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:05,883
to find out who the killer is.

319
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:08,617
ANNOUNCER:  Tonight on Dateline,   a woman murdered.

320
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:10,117
Was it her ex-boyfriend?

321
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:11,817
Yes, it was.

322
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:12,917
I knew it.

323
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:15, 83
I knew it was the ex-boyfriend.

324
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:20,117
"Sleep tight, truck.

325
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:22,750
"Sleep tight, firefly.

326
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,883
"Sleep tight, chair.

327
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:27,250
Sleep tight, bird."

328
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,383
You see that, Peter?

329
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:29,850
You see the bird?

330
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31, 50
Bird.

331
00:12:31, 50 --> 00:12:32,783
Okay, we'll, uh, pick up the rest tomorrow.

332
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:35,983
Uh, now, I'm just gonna vamp for a while with some random noises.

333
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:37,617
Hee-hee!

334
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:39,783
Heya, heya, heya.

335
00:12:39,783 --> 00:12:41,817
(grumbling, groaning)

336
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:42,983
Uh-heh, uh-heh...

337
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:45,217
(gibbering)

338
00:12:48, 83 --> 00:12:49, 83
Okay, good night, Peter.

339
00:12:49, 83 --> 00:12:50,150
Good night, Dave.

340
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,717
LETTERMAN: And, uh, here's Paul

341
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,117
to play you to sleep with a lullaby.

342
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:54,817
PAUL (off-key): ♪ Hey, lullaby... ♪

343
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:55,983
♪ Oh, lullaby ♪

344
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58, 50
♪ Hey, you, lullaby... ♪

345
00:12:58, 50 --> 00:12:58,883
Stop, no, stop.

346
00:12:58,883 --> 00:12:59,883
Stop.

347
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:01,817
I forgot, he's terrible.

348
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,917
TV ANNOUNCER:  We now return to Cops With Banana Guns.

349
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,117
Freeze!

350
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:11,950
Is that... is that a banana?

351
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,350
Don't worry about what it is.

352
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,117
I'm still a cop.

353
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:16,383
Whoa, hold on.

354
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:18,383
All-All right, just... just take it easy.

355
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:20,683
This can go a couple of ways.

356
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,717
What the hell did Peter do to  Cops?!

357
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:25,150
Bonnie! Come push me out in a huff!

358
00:13:30, 83 --> 00:13:31,750
Peter, what is this show?

359
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,883
It's called  Creeping Up  on the Kardashians.

360
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:35,817
See that guy with the ponytail in the background?

361
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:37,783
He sneaks up and scares the girls

362
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,250
while they're starting businesses

363
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,717
or getting their fat waxed.

364
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:41,983
(all scream)

365
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:43, 50
What the hell?!

366
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,250
(crowd clamoring)

367
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,383
There they are! That's the Nielsen family!

368
00:13:48,383 --> 00:13:49,883
You ruined television!

369
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:52,150
Now it's just a big, old, silly mess!

370
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,683
Oh, God! An angry mob!

371
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:57,383
I've got to swallow all my valuables and get out of here!

372
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:10,883
Did you see the mob?

373
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12, 17
Did I see the mob?

374
00:14:12, 17 --> 00:14:13,617
Why else am I here?

375
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:18,783
(clamoring)

376
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:21,183
Oh, my God, Peter, they're really angry!

377
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,850
Say something!

378
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,917
W-Wait. What the hell's going on?

379
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,350
What do you mean, I ruined television?

380
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,617
You put a real cougar on  Cougar Town,

381
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,883
and now that cougar's dead

382
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:31,650
because Courtney Cox ripped it apart with her teeth and claws!

383
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,350
You turned  Anderson Cooper 360 into  Anderson Cooper 720!

384
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,883
He's turning around too much!

385
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:39,283
You converted  The Biggest Loser to the metric system!

386
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:41,283
Now it feels like they're not losing enough!

387
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:42,783
Aw, the hell with you guys!

388
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:45,383
You're just jealous 'cause I get to say what's on TV now!

389
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:47,650
I am a Nielsen god!

390
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,650
(cheering)

391
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55, 83
Sorry, y'all.

392
00:14:55, 83 --> 00:14:57,650
That's the first time I ever throwed anything.

393
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:04,983
Well, if it isn't Mr. Nielsen himself.

394
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:07,183
Nurse, who's the worst doctor in this hospital?

395
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:08,617
You are, Dr. Hartman.

396
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10, 83
Good. Put Hartman on this bozo.

397
00:15:10, 83 --> 00:15:11,650
Hey, what can I do for you?

398
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,683
Please, Doc, you got to help me with this nasty gash.

399
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:14,717
What seems to be the problem?

400
00:15:14,717 --> 00:15:15,917
No, it's my husband.

401
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:18,150
Oh. Well, you've got a lot of nerve coming in here

402
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,383
after what you did to television.

403
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:20,750
Now, get out!

404
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,650
Please, Doctor, you've got to help him.

405
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,783
You took an oath when you went to medical school.

406
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:26,817
I took a lot of things when I went to medical school.

407
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:28,617
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to answer this.

408
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:29,817
Hello?

409
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:31,383
Ah, Hartman!

410
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:37,283
Hey, guys. How you doing?

411
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:38,317
Not so good, Peter.

412
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:39,650
Yeah, me, either.

413
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,683
Thanks to you, TV's a vast wasteland.

414
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:42,750
You know how I know that phrase?

415
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,117
I read it in a book, you monster!

416
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:45,750
Aw, come on, let me make it up to you.

417
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,783
Let me buy you a beer.

418
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:48,717
No, that seat's taken.

419
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:49,783
Move along, Peter.

420
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,283
What are you talking about?

421
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,317
You guys are my pals.

422
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:53,617
We used to be, Peter.

423
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:54,717
Now, scram.

424
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:56,750
Well, fine, I'll sit at the bar.

425
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,383
Not at my bar, you won't.

426
00:15:58,383 --> 00:15:59,683
Get out of here!

427
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:01,883
Geez, I can't show my face anywhere.

428
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,617
I might as well be back doing public radio.

429
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:05,817
This is Peter Griffin,

430
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:09,183
and you're listening to  Book Talk on WRNI.

431
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:10,683
Today we'll be discussing

432
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:12,350
Bret Easton Ellis's popular work,

433
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16, 83
Less Than Zero, a tale of privilege, detachment

434
00:16:16, 83 --> 00:16:18,283
and youthful alienation.

435
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:20,117
(taking a long, loud sip of tea)

436
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:23,683
But first, a word from our sponsor,

437
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,717
Westin's Golden Soda Biscuits.

438
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:27,617
I'm enjoying one right now.

439
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:29,750
(crunches biscuit)

440
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31, 17
Mmm.

441
00:16:31, 17 --> 00:16:34,983
(sips, then crunches)

442
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:36,717
Mmm.

443
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:40,117
(sips tea, crunches biscuit)

444
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:41,717
Mmm.

445
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:45,217
(sips tea, crunches biscuit)

446
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,950
(sips tea)

447
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,950
Mmm.

448
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,750
That concludes today's session of  Book Talk.

449
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,717
Tune in tomorrow when we will look at John Kennedy Toole's

450
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:03,650
unheralded early work,  The Neon Bible.

451
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09, 50
Hey, what's wrong, Peter?

452
00:17:09, 50 --> 00:17:10,783
I miss my friends, Brian.

453
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:12,917
I mean, I was having fun with those Nielsen boxes,

454
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:14,683
but what's the point

455
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:17,117
if I don't got Joe and Quagmire to enjoy it with me?

456
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:19,950
I guess I shouldn't have messed with television.

457
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,950
Well, it's not exactly your fault.

458
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,350
The networks never should have listened to you

459
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,783
in the first place.

460
00:17:24,783 --> 00:17:26,250
This is exactly what makes bad television:

461
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,183
pandering to the lowest common denominator.

462
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:29,817
So what do I do, Brian?

463
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,350
Well, you still have these boxes.

464
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,283
That means you still have the power to influence television.

465
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:36,383
Maybe you can use that power to help restore TV

466
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:37,717
to the way it was.

467
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:38,717
You're right, Brian.

468
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:40,717
Maybe if I watch smart, quality shows,

469
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:42,383
that'll help get things back to the way they were.

470
00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:44,783
We can use these boxes for good and...

471
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,683
What the hell?!

472
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:51,217
That's for adding another tree to  One Tree Hill!

473
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:53,683
Oh, my God, he destroyed every last box!

474
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:54,983
Holy crap!

475
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:56,283
We're sunk now, Peter.

476
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,650
There goes your one chance to get TV back to the way it was.

477
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,617
Wait a minute. Maybe not, Brian.

478
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:04,250
I think I just got an idea.

479
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,183
Aah! I got glass in my face!

480
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:08,650
Oh, crap. Now I forgot what it was.

481
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,717
I got it!

482
00:18:09,717 --> 00:18:11,183
Aah! Son of a bitch!

483
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:15,850
You know who I hate?

484
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,883
The troops.

485
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:18,217
Yeah, me, too.

486
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:19,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who are you?

487
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,950
I'm Peter Griffin.

488
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,350
I'm the guy who ruined television,

489
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,750
and I'm the guy who's gonna fix it.

490
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,783
Guys!

491
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:25,817
I broke television,

492
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:27,350
and now you have to help me fix it!

493
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,283
Yah-ha!

494
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:30,783
Looks like this is one we beat you to.

495
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,750
Gentlemen, I have gathered you all here today

496
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,250
because you are the creators of what television used to be

497
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,650
before I ruined it.

498
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,250
And we need to rebuild television from the ground up.

499
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,183
So, I'm gonna need all your best ideas.

500
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:49,117
J.J. Abrams, you take wonder and complexity

501
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:51,217
and present it in a way that no one can possibly understand.

502
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,283
Whaddaya got?!

503
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:54,250
I've got an alien that goes back in time

504
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,350
and encounters a koala bear in an Eastern European town.

505
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,883
Totally confused. Do it!

506
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:01,283
Okay, now, we're gonna need 15 workplace comedies

507
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:03,350
where people talk to the camera for some reason.

508
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,350
You, you, you and you-- go.

509
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:07,750
When Peter told me to make

510
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,117
a workplace comedy where people talk

511
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:10,217
to the camera, I thought...

512
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12, 83
Not now! I mean, go do a show!

513
00:19:12, 83 --> 00:19:14,283
Don't-don't do that thing here.

514
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,317
Huh.

515
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:16,817
Wonder if I can pull off one of those

516
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:18,850
"can you believe what I have to put up with" looks

517
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,150
to the camera.

518
00:19:23, 83 --> 00:19:25,817
Okay, Mark Burnett, you did  Survivor and  The Apprentice.

519
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:28,617
Can you give me a reality show where people do horrible,

520
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30, 17
unforgiveable things to each other

521
00:19:30, 17 --> 00:19:31,717
for embarrassingly small sums of money?

522
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:32,883
I got some ideas.

523
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:35,717
Here's a nickel, pull down your pants.

524
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,950
There's a show.

525
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,217
Yah-ha! Go!

526
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41, 50
All right, now, who's gonna make a show

527
00:19:41, 50 --> 00:19:42,150
about horrible New Jersey freaks?

528
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,317
You know what? I don't care.

529
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:44,317
Just someone, do it!

530
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,383
Okay, Dick Wolf,

531
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:48,650
make the same  Law and Order six times.

532
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,650
Oh, and also, could you marry Matt Weiner

533
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,750
'cause I want your name to be Dick "Weener."

534
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,917
Okay, but can I go by "Dick Wolf-Weener"?

535
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,883
Oh, my God, yes! Yes! Yes!

536
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:58,317
Okay, Bravo people, go find women fighting.

537
00:19:58,317 --> 00:19:59,983
No, you know what, just find women.

538
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:01,250
They'll end up fighting.

539
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,717
All right, everyone who's left, make a talent show.

540
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:05,217
We are done.

541
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:08,683
Oh, Kelsey Grammer, what are you still doing here?

542
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:10, 17
I-I have nothing left for you.

543
00:20:10, 17 --> 00:20:11,217
I'm... I'm sorry.

544
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:14,950
Ah. Then I shall take my ease on the lanai.

545
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,383
I don't care what you do now.

546
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:23, 50
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to  Mike and Molly.

547
00:20:23, 50 --> 00:20:24,917
Have you decided what you'd like to order?

548
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,250
Yes, the chopped salad?

549
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,183
I'll have everything except that.

550
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,250
(studio audience laughing)

551
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,350
(laughing)

552
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,750
That waiter's like, "What?!"

553
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,883
Well, you did it, Peter.

554
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,617
You got TV back to normal.

555
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:36,750
Yeah, guys, I'm sorry for screwing up

556
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38, 17
all your favorite shows.

557
00:20:38, 17 --> 00:20:39,283
Ah, that's okay, Peter.

558
00:20:39,283 --> 00:20:40,283
So, what do you say?

559
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:41,383
Are we pals again?

560
00:20:41,383 --> 00:20:43,350
Ah, course we are. You bet.

561
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,183
Well, let's drink to having TV

562
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,750
back in the hands of people who know what they're doing.

563
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,625
I think  Zack and Cody would be funnier

564
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:51,625
if they did the show in their underpants.
