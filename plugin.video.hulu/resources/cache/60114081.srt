1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,125
- Previously on  Grimm...

2
00:00:02,458 --> 00:00:03,392
- Hank's gotta be shook up

3
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:06,128
about this in some way.

4
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:08,931
This is not like your ordinary nightmare, okay?

5
00:00:08,997 --> 00:00:10,265
He knows he was awake.

6
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:12,167
- [grunting]

7
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:14,470
[gasps]

8
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,805
I don't have any powers.

9
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:18,440
[cat screeches] - Ooh, ow!

10
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:20,275
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

11
00:00:20,342 --> 00:00:22,878
- Yeah, it's okay, Adalind.  - Where's Adalind?

12
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:24,446
- Why would you think I know where she is?

13
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:26, 14
- She played one last little trick.

14
00:00:26, 81 --> 00:00:28,350
She put Nick's girlfriend in a coma.

15
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:29,952
- Juliette? You're awake.

16
00:00:30, 18 --> 00:00:33,355
- who are you?

17
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,868
- You're gonna have to talk to your counselor tomorrow

18
00:00:48,934 --> 00:00:51,270
if you want to change those classes.

19
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:52,938
- But I don't want to change them.

20
00:00:53,  5 --> 00:00:54,340
- Yeah, I know,

21
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:57,166
but in my humble opinion, five A.P. Classes

22
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:59,168
is a bit much.

23
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,577
It's your senior year for crying out loud.

24
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,412
You've gotta save a little bit of time for fun.

25
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,715
- I'm pretty sure that's what college is for, dad.

26
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:08,284
I'm gonna go finish my essay.

27
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,585
Love you. - Love you too.

28
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,220
You want me to wake you up in the morning?

29
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:13,489
- No, I only have a few more days to sleep in.

30
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:15,324
I'll go see the counselor tomorrow,

31
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,359
but I'm not promising I'm dropping all the a.P.S.

32
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:21, 96
- Laundry. - got it.

33
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:33,575
- [growls]

34
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:42,518
- Hi. - Hi.

35
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:45,487
I know you.

36
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:47,556
You're the policeman that brought me to the hospital.

37
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:50,125
Dr. Saliman told me all about you.

38
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,161
I owe you a thank you. - No...

39
00:01:52,227 --> 00:01:54,330
it's no problem.

40
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:57,633
- Those are pretty. - They're for you.

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,104
- What's that for?

42
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:06, 41
- These are some pictures. - of what?

43
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:07,509
- Can I just show you?

44
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:09,712
- Yeah. Yeah.

45
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,620
- How you feeling? - I'm okay.

46
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,388
I just want to get out of here.

47
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:22,391
- What did the doctors say? - Not a whole lot.

48
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,792
They said I looked pretty good

49
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:25,761
for a girl who's been in a coma for three days.

50
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:28,631
- And what about that scratch?

51
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:30,532
- That cat scratch? They don't seem to think

52
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,767
it's a big deal.

53
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:33,636
I don't really know.

54
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:37,206
So what are these pictures?

55
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,386
That's you and me in front of my house.

56
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:53,822
- Yeah.

57
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:01,430
- It looks like we know each other pretty well.

58
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:04,199
- Yeah.

59
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:06,669
- Oh, that's Margaret.

60
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:08,203
She works at the clinic with me.

61
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,505
And that's bala. I delivered that dog.

62
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:10,673
- [laughs]

63
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,442
So you remember where you work?

64
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,311
- Yeah, of course.

65
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:17,346
I've worked there for five years.

66
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:24,219
- All right, this was taken two years ago

67
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:27,590
at Chris and Melissa's house.

68
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:32,561
- Chris and Melissa Becker.

69
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:36,332
Well, I guess we really know each other pretty well.

70
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:39,201
Like--Like really well.

71
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:41,570
Like...

72
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,572
like sleeping together well?

73
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:48,110
- We live together.

74
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:51,614
- Oh.

75
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:54,216
For how long?

76
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:56,151
- three years.

77
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,197
- I don't know what to say.

78
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:10,532
- You don't have to say anything.

79
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,334
It's just--

80
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:14,336
- Can I hold on to that for a little while?

81
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:17,373
- Absolutely. Yeah.

82
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:25,681
- I guess I'm feeling a little tired, actually.

83
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:38,827
- I'll stop in later.

84
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:51,640
- [gasps]

85
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:52,641
- [growls]

86
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,678
[growling]

87
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:03,752
- There once was a man who lived a life so strange,

88
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,322
it had to be true.

89
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:09,124
Only he could see what no one else can--

90
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:10,726
The darkness inside.

91
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:13,662
The real monster within.

92
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:18,267
And he's the one who must stop them.

93
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,736
This is his calling.

94
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:23, 72
This is his duty.

95
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:25,674
This is the life of a Grimm.

96
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:41,557
- We're in a gray area, medically speaking.

97
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:44, 26
We don't know the extent of Juliette's memory loss,

98
00:05:44, 93 --> 00:05:46,395
or even which areas of her brain are affected.

99
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:48,397
- Well, she seems to be remembering a lot of stuff.

100
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:49,531
- [quiet chuckle]

101
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:53,302
- People, places... dogs.

102
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:56, 71
Just not me.

103
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,474
- There is the possibility of prosopagnosia,

104
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,144
when a patient has trouble recognizing familiar faces.

105
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04, 46
I've seen cases when a mother can't recognize

106
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,581
her own children, but as I said,

107
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:08,284
we won't know until we've done more tests.

108
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,486
- So there's nothing I can do?

109
00:06:10,552 --> 00:06:12,488
- For right now, the best thing you can do is be patient

110
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:15,157
and try and help her remember.

111
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,404
- Why can't I remember you?

112
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,681
- Come on.

113
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:40,683
- Come on. - She's not gonna come out?

114
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:42,551
I'll come get you out.

115
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:46,455
There you go. Come on. - [muffled] no...no...

116
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:48,390
come on. - She's kinda feisty.

117
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:52,161
- Hey! Hey! Hey, knock it off!

118
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:55,598
- I got her, Todd. - [muffled cries]

119
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:58,601
- Yeah, there we go. There we go.

120
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:02,738
- Ooh, we've got the perfect place for you, little lady.

121
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,473
This'll cool you off.

122
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,676
- [struggling]

123
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:13,349
[muffled cries]

124
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:18,387
- You got it? - Yeah, I got it. Come on.

125
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,222
- It's okay.

126
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,224
It's okay. - You got it?

127
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,126
Here we go. - It's okay.

128
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,596
[laughter]

129
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:29,465
- Easy does it.

130
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:34,670
- [muffled cries]

131
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:37,506
- [chuckles]

132
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:40,376
sleep tight. - [chuckles]

133
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:43,345
- Nighty-Night.

134
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,347
- You said you were having trouble sleeping

135
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,249
and some periods of anxiety?

136
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:50,753
- Yeah.

137
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53, 88
Yes, that's right.

138
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,658
- How long has this been going on?

139
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:58,360
- a few weeks.

140
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:00, 95
- Can you describe your feelings?

141
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:04,466
Just...jumpy.

142
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,669
Uh...

143
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:10,973
I'm on edge all the time.

144
00:08:11, 40 --> 00:08:13,609
A lot of strange stuff going on lately.

145
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,344
- Like what?

146
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:22,618
[hisses] - Oh!

147
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,620
[Rats squeaking]

148
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:28,324
it's kinda hard to explain.

149
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,626
- and when did the nightmares begin?

150
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:36,398
- [growls]

151
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:43,672
- I was on a murder case.

152
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:48, 77
Witnesses were having trouble remembering what they saw.

153
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:52,548
My partner and I secured a suspect at a theater.

154
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,149
[gunshots]

155
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:57,119
- [cries out]

156
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:59,989
- I shot him.

157
00:09:00, 55 --> 00:09:02,391
- that must have been very upsetting.

158
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,595
- It's what happened after that.

159
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:10,466
He--he changed.

160
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:12,167
- What do you mean?

161
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:15,204
- After--After he fell,

162
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:18,474
after I shot him...

163
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,676
- What do you see?

164
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:24,747
What are you remembering?

165
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:27,283
Detective Griffin?

166
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:31,553
- [strained groan]

167
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:38,427
- He changed.

168
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,300
I know he did. I saw it.

169
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,371
- Detective Griffin--

170
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:50,639
[gasps, cries out] Detective Griffin!

171
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:54,109
Detective Griffin!

172
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:58,614
- [panting] I'm sorry.

173
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,250
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

174
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:05,487
- I-I think we just need to go a little slower.

175
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:08,257
Why don't you sit back down?

176
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:12,227
- Yeah, you're right. The, uh...

177
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:14,496
shooting got to me.

178
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:17, 66
- Well, there's a lot more to it than that.

179
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:18,667
Please, sit back down.

180
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,235
- Look, uh, thanks,

181
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:21,403
but I gotta be getting back to work.

182
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,405
- Well, we still have some time.

183
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:27,610
- I appreciate your help...

184
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:30,479
but I've gotta go.

185
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,554
- all I'm saying is, odds are,

186
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:40,689
if she doesn't know you, she's not gonna know me.

187
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:42,391
- I know, but we were the last two people she saw

188
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,826
before She went out.

189
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:46,795
- that, actually, might not be such a good thing.

190
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:49,698
Oh, I forgot to bring her flowers too!

191
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:51,433
Nick, you know,

192
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,402
just don't get your hopes up, that's all.

193
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,170
- They're not up. I'm just thinking

194
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,207
maybe seeing us together will help jog her memory of me.

195
00:10:58,274 --> 00:10:59,508
- that's assuming she remembers me,

196
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,443
which I seriously do not think is gonna--

197
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,545
- Monroe?

198
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:05,514
What are you doing here?

199
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,517
- Uh, wha--I...

200
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,519
just wanted to see if--

201
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,521
I mean, we, Nick and I--

202
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,124
we wanted to see if you, you know, how you're doing?

203
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,126
You remember Nick?

204
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:19,128
- I'm trying.

205
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:21, 63
- You remember Monroe?

206
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,399
- Yeah, of course. He saved my life.

207
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:26,669
- Actually, Nick was kind of primarily the guy

208
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:28,203
who saved your life.

209
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,540
- You were? - Sort of.

210
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:35,811
- Hey, I got a-- Just--

211
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:38,580
Remember that dinner party you had at your place,

212
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:39,815
and you made that delicious honey Pepper

213
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:41,183
cedar Plank vegan Salmon?

214
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,185
- right. I gave you the recipe.

215
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:46,689
- Yeah. So you remember who was there?

216
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:48,557
- You and me.

217
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,163
- Well, I'm gonna go.

218
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:55,698
Why don't you two talk a bit?

219
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57, 66
You know, catch up and all that.

220
00:11:57,132 --> 00:11:59,168
- Okay, sure. I mean, why not?

221
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:02,304
- All right. Bye.

222
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:05,207
- Bye.

223
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,677
I'm glad you dropped by. How have you been?

224
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:12,147
- Oh, good. Yeah. - Good.

225
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:15,117
- and you've been-- You've been here.

226
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:17,419
- I have been here.

227
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,356
- How are they treating you?

228
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:23,626
- How do you know Nick?

229
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:27,296
- Oh...uh...

230
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,431
[sighs]

231
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:36,171
- I guess she's calmed down, you know?

232
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:38,774
[Pulley squeaking]

233
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,288
- [gasps]

234
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,160
who are you?

235
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,229
- Don't you remember, Carly? [sniffs]

236
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,631
last time I saw you, you were finger painting

237
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,534
on the side of my house and your mama got real mad.

238
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:10,539
- Mm, not as mad as we got when you all took off.

239
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,241
- Your daddy brought shame down on us

240
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:14,376
when he took your mama and you away.

241
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:17, 79
- What are you gonna do to me?

242
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:22,551
- We're gonna take you back into the pack.

243
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:25, 87
- It's good to see you again.

244
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,166
- These are the photographs of Catherine Schade's body.

245
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,402
- Any suspects? - Not yet.

246
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:43, 71
It was a hell of a fight.

247
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,543
We checked with her place of employment,

248
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,145
but there was none.

249
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:49,214
Her house is paid for, so is her car.

250
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,183
Plenty of money in the bank, so whatever she was up to,

251
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,485
it was a cash business.

252
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,220
- You think she was dealing?

253
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:57,522
- Her house was full of herbs, roots,

254
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:00, 91
medicinal stuff-- And a lot of mirrors.

255
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:02,427
We've got the lab tech sorting through it now

256
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:03,995
to see if there are any controlled substances.

257
00:14:04, 62 --> 00:14:05,296
- She have any relatives?

258
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:07,132
- a daughter. - We have a name?

259
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:08,767
- Adalind Schade..

260
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,169
- Yeah, I remember her. She was, uh...

261
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:14,105
one of the lawyers we had to protect--Very pretty.

262
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,341
We know where she is? - No.

263
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:17,509
She disappeared.

264
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:18,943
Her landlord says she took off

265
00:14:19, 10 --> 00:14:20,278
around the time her mom was murdered.

266
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:21,946
No forwarding address.

267
00:14:22, 13 --> 00:14:23,848
Her cell Phone was canceled.

268
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:25,383
- You think the daughter might have done it?

269
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,952
- I think we need to find her.

270
00:14:28, 19 --> 00:14:30,822
- So do I.

271
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:33,191
[phones ringing, chatter]

272
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:34,893
- Hey.

273
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,161
How are you doing?

274
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:37,429
- Hanging in there.

275
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:39,998
- You don't sound like it.

276
00:14:40, 65 --> 00:14:42,467
- [Chuckles]

277
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:47,806
look, I've been doing this a long time, and, uh,

278
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:49,441
I think maybe it's starting to get to me.

279
00:14:49,507 --> 00:14:51,509
- Well, there's been a lot of stress lately.

280
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:53,578
- I put three bullet holes in my closet, Nick,

281
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:56,514
and there wasn't anything there.

282
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,416
I just came from seeing a therapist,

283
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,819
and to be honest, I lost it.

284
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:03, 54
- You're a good cop, Hank.

285
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:06,191
- I was. I'm not so sure anymore.

286
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:12,964
Hey, look...

287
00:15:13, 31 --> 00:15:14,332
now, I know a lot of weird stuff

288
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,101
has been going on lately, but--

289
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,403
- I'm thinking about going to the captain, Nick.

290
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,938
I'm not sure I can do this any more.

291
00:15:20,  4 --> 00:15:22,874
- Hank-- - Look, I don't trust myself.

292
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,275
And that's not good for either of us.

293
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:27,479
- listen to me.

294
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:30,348
You and I need to talk,

295
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:31,983
you know, about some of these things

296
00:15:32, 50 --> 00:15:35,387
that have been going on lately.

297
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:37,389
I-- - Hank.

298
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:39,958
There's a guy here asking to see you.

299
00:15:40, 25 --> 00:15:42,227
Seems pretty upset. Says he knows you.

300
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:43,561
Jarold kampfer?

301
00:15:43,628 --> 00:15:45,997
- Yeah, I know him. Where is he?

302
00:15:46, 64 --> 00:15:48, 33
- Coming at you.

303
00:15:48, 99 --> 00:15:50,135
- Hey, man, what's going on?

304
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,170
- Hey.

305
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:53,872
I'm sorry to bother you, Hank,

306
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,141
but I think something's happened to Carly.

307
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,309
- Carly? Are you kidding?

308
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:01,780
Here, sit down. - Thanks.

309
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:02,914
- Jarold, this is detective Burkhardt,

310
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:03,915
my partner. Nick...

311
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:05, 83
- Hey. - Hey.

312
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,451
- Jarold kampfer,

313
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:08,853
old friend.

314
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,424
Now, you think, uh--is Carly in some kind of trouble?

315
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,491
- Yeah, I don't know.

316
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:16,127
Um, she was supposed to meet

317
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:17,762
with her school counselor this morning

318
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19, 30
and she didn't show up,

319
00:16:19, 97 --> 00:16:21,332
and that's not like her at all.

320
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,501
- When was the last time you saw her?

321
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:26,971
- Uh, last night, before she went to sleep.

322
00:16:27, 38 --> 00:16:28,873
Uh, I left early this morning for work,

323
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,242
so I didn't want to wake her up, so I didn't check on her.

324
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:34,212
And then I got the call at work from her counselor

325
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,381
asking where she was, so I went home,

326
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:40,118
checked in her room, and her cell phone was there.

327
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:42,520
She never leaves her cell phone at home.

328
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,789
Her laundry was there, her bed was made.

329
00:16:44,856 --> 00:16:46,358
She never makes her bed,

330
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,526
so I don't even think she slept in it last night.

331
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:50,362
- All right, was there any sign of forced entry?

332
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:51,963
- No, no, no.

333
00:16:52, 30 --> 00:16:53,798
I mean, Hank, I don't know where she is.

334
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:56,134
- Have you or Carly RECEIVED any threats?

335
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:57,268
- No.

336
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:58,870
- How old's your daughter?

337
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:01,139
- She just turned 17. - Right, right, right.

338
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:02,340
A couple weeks ago. - Yeah.

339
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:04,209
- She still seeing that Robert guy?

340
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06, 44
- No, no, they broke up last month,

341
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:08, 12
but I called him. I called her friends.

342
00:17:08, 79 --> 00:17:10,281
Nobody's seen her. Nobody knows where she is.

343
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:11,483
- What about her mom?

344
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:13,752
- No, Lisa passed five years ago.

345
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:15, 86
It's just Carly and me.

346
00:17:15,153 --> 00:17:16,287
- was there anything missing from her room?

347
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:18,356
Um, clothes, computer?

348
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:19,491
- No.

349
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:21, 26
- Was your daughter involved

350
00:17:21, 92 --> 00:17:23,294
in any groups, gangs?

351
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:26,431
- No, no, she's never been in any kind of trouble.

352
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:28, 99
[sobs]

353
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,101
it doesn't make any sense at all.

354
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:33,238
And I didn't want to call the police

355
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:35,240
until I was sure something was wrong.

356
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:38, 43
- Okay.

357
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:39,310
Is there anything we need to know

358
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:41,112
about your personal life?

359
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,515
You know, uh, work, associates,

360
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,383
anybody you might owe money to?

361
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,385
- Nick, I-I've known jarold since high school.

362
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:48,520
We were on the football team together.

363
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,221
Carly's my goddaughter.

364
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:52,991
- I'm really, really worried, Hank.

365
00:17:53, 58 --> 00:17:54,292
- I know.

366
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,860
Now, let us check out a few things

367
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:57,429
before we file a missing persons report.

368
00:17:57,495 --> 00:17:59,864
I'm gonna need the names and numbers

369
00:17:59,931 --> 00:18:01,266
of anybody she could be with

370
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:03,134
or anybody who might know where she is.

371
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:05, 70
- Okay.

372
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:08,139
- jarold.

373
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:10,875
I promise you, we will find her.

374
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,381
- I'm gonna go run some predators.

375
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:19, 17
- All right.

376
00:18:20, 51 --> 00:18:22, 87
- Coyotls. Ugh.

377
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:25, 90
Mean, nasty, little bullies.

378
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:26,124
The kind of guys you don't want to run into

379
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:27,492
in a dark alley

380
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,361
or a parking garage, under the bleachers.

381
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,830
- Okay, we're talking street gangs of the wesen world?

382
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:33,398
- Yeah, pretty much, I mean,

383
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:36,234
minus the black leather jackets and the steel-Toed boots.

384
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:38,136
- So it would be a big deal to leave the pack?

385
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:40,372
- Dude, the biggest.

386
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:42,774
I mean, they're like, "once in, never out."

387
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:44,843
It's a serious no-No.

388
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:47,245
You really know a coyotl who did and lived to tell about it?

389
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:49,781
- Maybe.

390
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:51,316
- huh.

391
00:18:51,383 --> 00:18:54,152
- These look like fertility symbols.

392
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:55,887
You have any idea what that means?

393
00:18:55,954 --> 00:19:00, 25
- Uh, well, Nick, when a mommy coyotl

394
00:19:00, 91 --> 00:19:02,327
and a daddy coyotl Love each other very much--

395
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:04,195
- Okay.

396
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:06, 31
- Typical coyotl.

397
00:19:06, 97 --> 00:19:08,199
I mean, it's all about breeding.

398
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:12,504
Or inbreeding, as the case usually is.

399
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,408
The female is taken by a member of the pack

400
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:19,844
into the fertility matrix.

401
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:22,213
That's the stakes with the skulls, I'm guessing.

402
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,183
- So are we talking about some kind of mating ritual?

403
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:28,153
- According to this,

404
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:31,122
that's how they introduce females to the pack.

405
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:32,791
[scoffs] No wonder Hank's Buddy

406
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:34,225
moved back to portland.

407
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,294
Talk about in-Laws.

408
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:39,264
Says here they must complete the  aseveracion,

409
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,366
or "Ritual consummation"

410
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:45,  3
After the female's 17th year.

411
00:19:45, 70 --> 00:19:48, 73
The whole ceremony starts with ritual feasts,

412
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:50,542
where coyotls Slaughter dogs and other small animals.

413
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:53,278
Interesting footnote:

414
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:55,947
The number 17 represents immortality,

415
00:19:56, 14 --> 00:19:59,551
which supposedly breeds strength and longevity into the pack.

416
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:02,153
- Does it mention when after the 17th year

417
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,389
this consummation is supposed to take place?

418
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:08,293
- Sure does. It's one of the classics.

419
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10, 61
Under the full moon.

420
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:11,563
- Well, let me guess, that's-- - Tonight.

421
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:13,898
It's not a good night for me. I'm staying in.

422
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:15,567
- Well, I gotta go.

423
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,103
- Hey, don't you want to hear how it went with Juliette?

424
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:19,371
- Well, does she remember me?

425
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:22,374
- Uh, well, no, but listen,

426
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,442
doesn't it seem strange that the only thing

427
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:26,244
Juliette doesn't remember is you?

428
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:29, 13
Like, maybe that was Adalind's plan all along.

429
00:20:29, 80 --> 00:20:30,815
- Yeah, but I've gotta find this girl.

430
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:32, 50
Okay, thanks for talking to Juliette.

431
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:35,220
I'm gonna call you. - Okay.

432
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:39,157
Oh, man.

433
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:47, 32
- I don't know, Hank, these are all her friends.

434
00:20:47, 98 --> 00:20:49, 67
None of these people have it in for her,

435
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:50,435
and I've talked to most of them already.

436
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:52, 70
- We've got to talk to all of them.

437
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:53,505
- How you guys doin'?

438
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:55,940
- Got a long list, that's about all.

439
00:20:56,  7 --> 00:20:56,941
What about you?

440
00:20:57,  8 --> 00:20:59,344
- Nothing concrete.

441
00:21:01, 12 --> 00:21:02, 80
- Hey, jarold, I'm gonna get some coffee.

442
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:03, 81
You want some?

443
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:04,115
- Yeah, that would be great.

444
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:05,917
Thank you.

445
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:15,160
- Look, I'm gonna tell you something,

446
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:17,162
and you're probably gonna get all upset,

447
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:20,432
but I want you to know, I am on your side.

448
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:22,834
Look, I know what you are.

449
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,869
- What are you talking about?

450
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:27,  5
- Uh, you're a coyotl--I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

451
00:21:27, 72 --> 00:21:28,907
Relax.

452
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:30,842
I'm a Grimm, and I'm gonna help you find your daughter,

453
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32, 10
but we don't have a lot of time

454
00:21:32, 77 --> 00:21:33,578
to talk before Hank gets back,

455
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:37,148
so if there's anything you think I should know,

456
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:39,350
now would be the time.

457
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:43,121
- Does Hank know about me or about you?

458
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:45, 23
- No.

459
00:21:45, 90 --> 00:21:48, 26
No, and that has not been easy to deal with.

460
00:21:48, 93 --> 00:21:49,894
- Yeah, I know.

461
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:51,896
- Could there be a coyotl connection

462
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:54,566
to your daughter's disappearance?

463
00:21:54,632 --> 00:21:57, 68
- I don't know.

464
00:21:57,135 --> 00:21:58,536
I never thought about that.

465
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:00,372
It's been so many years since we left.

466
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:02,140
Lisa and I wanted to raise Carly

467
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:05, 76
in a more normal environment.

468
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:08,546
- Look, what do you know about the  aseveracion?

469
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:11, 82
- I know it is a barbaric ritual

470
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:12,217
we don't want any part of,

471
00:22:12,283 --> 00:22:13,385
but that's Lisa's family,

472
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:15, 86
and they live back in texas...

473
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:19,257
Oh, my god. - What?

474
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:21,259
You just come up with something?

475
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:24,262
- Yeah, Lisa's family... [clears throat]

476
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:26,998
in Texas were pretty angry that we left.

477
00:22:27, 65 --> 00:22:29,401
Uh, accused me of breaking up the family,

478
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,269
and things got pretty heated,

479
00:22:31,336 --> 00:22:32,971
which is why I left the way I did,

480
00:22:33, 38 --> 00:22:36, 41
but I haven't spoken to them in over ten years.

481
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:37,542
- I know you never liked them, man,

482
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:39,310
but in all these years, you never talked about them

483
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:41,179
like they were crazy enough to do something like this.

484
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:43,281
- Yeah, well, there are some things about your family

485
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:46,251
you don't even tell your closest friends.

486
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:48,153
- All right, give me a name.

487
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:50,155
- Hayden.

488
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:53,158
It's his sister I married. Hayden Walker.

489
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:55,226
Do you really think This is-- - Well, it's a start.

490
00:22:55,293 --> 00:22:57,128
What happened when your wife died?

491
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:58,830
Did they come to the funeral?

492
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:01, 32
- No, they treated her like she never even existed.

493
00:23:01, 99 --> 00:23:03,101
- I thought you said Hayden Walker lived in texas.

494
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,904
- Yeah, he does. - Not anymore. He's here.

495
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,439
