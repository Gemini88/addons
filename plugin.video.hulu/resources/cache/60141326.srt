Boy, what a great day for a baseball game.

11
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:39,875
Yeah, and these are the best seats

12
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,742
in the house for catching home run balls.

13
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,208
Aw, that'd be sweet.

14
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,842
The only souvenir I ever got was at that stock car race.

15
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:54,842
All right, I got the guy!

16
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:56,208
I got the guy.

17
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,142
Man, I hate the Yankees.

18
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:02,142
Yeah! You are all villains to me

19
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:05,642
because I happen to live in this region of the country. Yeah!

20
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:06,642
(crowd cheering)

21
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:08,642
What's going on? Did I miss something?

22
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:10,775
Nah, just some idiot streaking across the field.

23
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:14,242
Ha ha. You're all looking at my penis.

24
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:17,608
You didn't plan on it, but it's happening.

25
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:20,342
Oh, cool. Two spots opened up.

26
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:22,275
You, uh-- y-you go ahead.

27
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:24,442
I can wait. I might-- I might wait for a stall.

28
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:25,775
Oh, come on, Peter.

29
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,875
We're missing the game.

30
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,675
(unzipping)

31
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:30,675
Hey. Hi.

32
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:31,875
Hey.

33
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,875
Peter:  Damn it.  He already started.

34
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,575
If I don't start peeing soon,  it's gonna be weird.

35
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:38,575
He'll be all done,  and I'll still be here.

36
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:39,642
Come on, Peter. Pee.

37
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:41,308
Your dad fought  in World War II,

38
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:43,175
and you can't even pee  in a urinal?

39
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:44,475
What the hell's  wrong with you?

40
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:45,742
All set? Yup.

41
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:46,708
(zipping)

42
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:47,842
I know you didn't go.

43
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:50,642
I'm'a go pee in a stairwell.

44
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:52,875
Stadium Announcer: Now batting for the Red Sox,

45
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,408
number 34, David Ortiz.

46
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:56,875
Come on, Big Papi!

47
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,708
(crack of bat, crowd cheering)

48
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,208
It's coming straight for us!

49
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,875
I got it, I got it!

50
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:04,675
Mine! I got it! It's my ball

51
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:06,508
Damn it, Brian! That came to me!

52
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:08,275
That's my ball!

53
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,675
(wind whistling) What?

54
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:11,275
Holy crap!

55
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:13,608
(crowd murmuring) (gasps)

56
00:02:15,142 --> 00:02:17,275
(crowd laughing hysterically)

57
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:21,142
(slowly increasing horrified scream)

58
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,808
Wow, I guess all this time,

59
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:24,808
Quagmire should've been saying "wiggity."

60
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:26,908
Ha! No, but he's our friend.

61
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:32,508
TV Announcer:  And now it's time

62
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:33,808
for  the Channel Five Sports Report

63
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,342
brought to you by Kia.

64
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:37,308
Kia: Too bad it's a Kia.

65
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:38,808
A big day at Fenway today,

66
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:41,308
as the Red Sox bested the Yankees seven to six.

67
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:43,175
But what really has everyone talking

68
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:45,575
is the fan who lost his toupee at the game.

69
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:47,208
The hilarious video already has

70
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,308
over two million views on YouTube.

71
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:52,342
Comments ranged from sympathy all the way to racial slurs

72
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:54,142
directed at others who chose to comment.

73
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:56,275
Great, I'm a laughingstock.

74
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:57,275
What do I do?

75
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:58,842
Come on, Quagmire. It's not so bad.

76
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:00,475
You could kill yourself.

77
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:02,175
Well, it's just a thought,

78
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,475
but have you ever considered just embracing your baldness?

79
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,842
Yeah, Brian's right.

80
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:07,842
You know, there's lots of big Hollywood celebrities

81
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:09,708
who have gone bald with dignity.

82
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,608
John Travolta, David Spade, Nicolas Cage, Jeremy Piven...

83
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:14,142
And besides, don't you think

84
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:16,175
you'll be happier just being who you really are?

85
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,908
(sighing): Maybe you're right. What the hell.

86
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:20,175
I mean, wh-what other choice do I have at this point?

87
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:21,542
Everybody knows now anyway.

88
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,542
Great. Trust me.

89
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,308
Nobody's gonna give you a hard time.

90
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:25,842
And even if they do, just ignore them.

91
00:03:25,842 --> 00:03:27,808
That's what I do with that weekend bully.

92
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,808
Hey, your weekend sucks!

93
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,575
I've already gone on a hike

94
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:33,842
and fixed a few things around my house!

95
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:35,142
What are you doing?!

96
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:36,275
Peter, who is that man?

97
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:37,742
I don't want to talk about it.

98
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:43,675
Dad, there's a weird bald guy out in front of our house.

99
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:44,808
Ah, that's just Quagmire.

100
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,908
He's acting all different now that he's bald.

101
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:47,908
I'll go talk to him.

102
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:50,642
Hey, slow down!

103
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:52,275
Drive like hell, you'll get there!

104
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,908
Quagmire, what the hell are you doing?

105
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:55,908
I'm just letting all these hot-rodders know

106
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:58,775
that this is a neighborhood, not a speedway track.

107
00:03:58,775 --> 00:03:59,908
Too fast, too fast!

108
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,308
Our children should not have to live in fear!

109
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,908
Okay, well, how come you're not doing this

110
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:05,542
in front of your own house?

111
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,542
Oh, my ham radio interferes with the radar gun.

112
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,708
Talked to a fella in Papua New Guinea last night.

113
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,875
You should come by sometime and join in the fun.

114
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,542
VOICE ON RADIO: Hello?

115
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:14,875
H-Hello?

116
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,708
Are you bald? (static crackles)

117
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,842
Yeah.

118
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:22,675
Can I help you?

119
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:24,342
Well, I hope you can, Sharon.

120
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:27,342
I'd just like to return this VHS copy of  Pete's Dragon.

121
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:30,342
Watched, enjoyed and rewound.

122
00:04:30,342 --> 00:04:32,342
Uh, there are a lot of people waiting.

123
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:33,775
Is there anything else?

124
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,842
Uh, yes. Do you have a garbage can back there?

125
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,242
I have the backings to some Fruit Roll-Ups I need to discard.

126
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:41,442
I'm sorry. That's for library trash only.

127
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:42,908
I understand. That's okay.

128
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,442
I'll just hold on to these for the rest of the day.

129
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,442
It ain't easy bein' green, huh? (weak chuckle)

130
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:48,775
That's from a song.

131
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:49,775
Is that all?

132
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,608
Yeah. Is there an age restriction

133
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:53,742
for the sleight-of-hand magic show this afternoon?

134
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,542
Twelve. Ooh.

135
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,908
Maybe I'll just stand in the hallway and look in.

136
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:00,775
Now, we all saw you put your card back in the deck.

137
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:03,842
So, how did it end up... in your shirt pocket?

138
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:07,742
Oh, my God, how did he do that?

139
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,875
Oh, no, there's Quagmire.

140
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,742
He's been so weird lately.

141
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:17,342
You notice now that he's bald,

142
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:19,675
whenever he thinks about something, he scratches his wrist?

143
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,542
Hey, Quagmire, we got a pitcher.

144
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,542
You want a beer?

145
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,708
Ehh, I don't think so.

146
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,842
I was planning on looking at pictures of birds later,

147
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:27,742
and I don't want to be all fuzzy-headed for that.

148
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,742
Listen, Quagmire, we hate you now.

149
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:31,275
Yeah, you used to be fun.

150
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,608
Yeah, now you're always either preparing for a colonoscopy

151
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,275
or just coming back from a colonoscopy.

152
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:36,742
The (bleep) going on down there?

153
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:38,742
Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.

154
00:05:38,742 --> 00:05:40,608
Come on, we want our buddy back.

155
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,275
I'm not putting that toupee on again, Peter.

156
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,708
So... I-I'm not sure what you want me to do.

157
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,375
You could get a hair transplant.

158
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,208
Oh, yeah. Like one of those guys pretending to get out of the pool.

159
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,508
That looks all right.

160
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:52,408
Yeah, come on, Quagmire. Get the hair transplant.

161
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:53,408
Come back to us.

162
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:55,308
You're right. This isn't me.

163
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:57,608
Baldness is for women's crotches, not men's heads.

164
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,708
There you go, that's pretty gross.

165
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,442
Yeah, that's the spirit, Quagmire.

166
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,542
Oh, boy, listen, thanks for putting up with me

167
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:05,208
the last couple weeks. Hey, no problem.

168
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,675
You put up with me when I was barefoot guy.

169
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:10,208
Boy, nothing like a beer with the fellas, eh?

170
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,642
Peter, would you mind putting on some shoes?

171
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:13,775
Oh, you mean foot prisons?

172
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:14,775
Yes, I would.

173
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:20,242
Glenn Quagmire?

174
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:21,642
Why does that name sound familiar?

175
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:23,342
Oh, yeah, I treated you for butt flu.

176
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,742
Hey, you want to keep it down?

177
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:26,242
Easy now. That's my privilege

178
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:28,242
as a doctor to talk about that stuff.

179
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,708
How's it going, Dr. Kamada?

180
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,708
Bob!

181
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,708
Mattaaayy.

182
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,475
Oh, hiya, Rachael.

183
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:40,142
Oh, hey, Dr. Geller.

184
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:41,475
Sarah.

185
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:43,142
Jim.

186
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:44,642
Merianna.

187
00:06:44,642 --> 00:06:45,608
Geez, Joe.

188
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:47,242
Yeah, I come here a lot.

189
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:48,575
All right, I'm gonna hit the john.

190
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,308
Good. Me and Joe can stay here and tell secrets.

191
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:53,642
I'm wearing my dead grandmother's panties.

192
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:56,608
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

193
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:59,408
Mr. Pewterschmidt, but the cancer is terminal.

194
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,575
If you're lucky, you've got two weeks to live.

195
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:03,442
I understand.

196
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:04,708
Oh, my God!

197
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,708
Carter's dying?!

198
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,642
I now declare this hair transplant officially over!

199
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:11,642
(fires gun)

200
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:12,608
Hey, hey, hey!

201
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:13,608
He's back!

202
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:15,575
You look great, Quagmire.

203
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:16,842
(pager beeping)

204
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:19,775
Oh, my God. One of my patients on two has been shot.

205
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:25,642
Hey, Stewie.

206
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:27,175
Um, hey, what's up?

207
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,475
Were you-- were you just looking at Rollerblades?

208
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:30,608
What? No. Yeah, who cares?

209
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:31,642
What do you want?

210
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:33,642
Listen, I was at the hospital earlier,

211
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,675
and I heard something I wish I hadn't.

212
00:07:35,675 --> 00:07:38,575
Oh, please do not tell me it was a sexist remark,

213
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:40,575
because... because that is not okay.

214
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:42,908
You know, those nurses are busting their asses,

215
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:45,208
weighing people and seeing how tall they are.

216
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,642
Stewie, I heard a doctor tell Carter he has two weeks to live.

217
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:50,575
What? Are you sure?

218
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:51,875
I saw it with my own eyes.

219
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,775
I gotta check this out.

220
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,575
Oh, my God, you're right!

221
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,808
He looks awful.

222
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:59,208
(beeping)

223
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,542
Wait, how are we seeing this?

224
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,742
Oh, I've got a nanny cam hidden inside his house.

225
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:05,742
Watching him nail his cleaning woman is how I'm learning Spanish.

226
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:08,508
Although I'm not sure what the Spanish word "no" means,

227
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:10,842
because it doesn't seem to mean the same thing as it does here.

228
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:13,675
And the worst part is, I don't think Lois even knows he's sick.

229
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,708
Oh, this is going to destroy her!

230
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,575
Oh, just thinking about it makes me all giddy.

231
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:20,642
Like a group of women ordering dessert.

232
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:22,608
And then we have a chocolate, chocolate cake

233
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:25,342
that's infused with chocolate served with chocolate ice cream

234
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:26,642
and a molten chocolate topping.

235
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:28,542
We'll have one of those with four spoons.

236
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,342
More like four of those with one spoon for me!

237
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:34,342
(continuous, staccato, giddy laughter)

238
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:44,542
Oh, hi, Brian.

239
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:45,675
Hey, Lois.

240
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:48,908
Listen, I have something I need to tell you, but...

241
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,608
it might be difficult for you to hear.

242
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:51,675
What is it?

243
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:52,808
Lois...

244
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,642
I think your father is dying.

245
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,408
What?! (flashbulb pops)

246
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:57,508
Ha!

247
00:08:57,508 --> 00:08:59,542
Brian, what are you talking about?

248
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,242
Well, yesterday at the hospital,

249
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:03,608
I heard a doctor tell him he has cancer...

250
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,542
and that he has two weeks to live.

251
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,175
Oh, my God.

252
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:08,708
Oh, my God, Daddy!

253
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,542
Yeah, I feel really horrible for you,

254
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,308
and I hate to do this,

255
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:13,808
but I'm trying to catch a 4:50 movie,

256
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:16,575
and it's, like, 4:40 now, and, so, if I'm going to make it,

257
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:18,575
I have to leave, like, now.

258
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,508
Yeah, this-this stinks,

259
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:27,675
but I've already blown this guy off, like, twice, so...

260
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:34,275
I've been trying to call my parents all day,

261
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:35,808
and I can't get ahold of them.

262
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,175
I'll tell ya, this obituary came out great.

263
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:41,408
"Carter Pewterschmidt died today of the disease cancer.

264
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:43,175
"In lieu of flowers, please send

265
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:46,442
carnival rides to Peter Griffin at 31 Spooner Street."

266
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,242
If we get just one ride out of this,

267
00:09:48,242 --> 00:09:49,575
it will have been a success.

268
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:55,408
Lois?

269
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:56,608
Wh-What are you doing here?

270
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,908
Mom, I've been trying to get ahold of you.

271
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:00,642
Is Daddy okay? Where is he?

272
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,642
Oh, he's fine, dear.

273
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:04,142
But now's not a good time.

274
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:05,575
He's very busy.

275
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,275
Look, I know something's going on.

276
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,375
I want to see him.

277
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:11,742
Daddy?!

278
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:14,508
Well, look who's here!

279
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:16,508
Daddy! You're okay!

280
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:18,275
Of course I'm okay! Why wouldn't I be?

281
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,608
Well, Brian said you were dying!

282
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:21,608
And I finished a book!

283
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:23,775
I promised myself I'd work that in.

284
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:25,775
I-It's-- I might've jumped the gun.

285
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:26,908
I didn't finish it.

286
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:29,442
I'm so glad you're all right.

287
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:32,142
Brian, how could you get us all worked up like that?!

288
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:33,608
Yeah, shame on you!

289
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:35,208
Oh, you're gonna get it, Brian.

290
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,542
You are gonna get it when I drink.

291
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,675
What the hell's going on?

292
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:41,475
Last night, Carter was on his deathbed,

293
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,142
and now he looks better than he ever did.

294
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,775
Well, they say laughter is the best medicine.

295
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:46,742
Maybe he went to a comedy club or something.

296
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,275
(audience laughing)

297
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:49,275
In my neighborhood,

298
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:50,575
we didn't have no Kool-Aid.

299
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:52,575
We had food colorin' and water.

300
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,442
Mama used to call it "Fool-Aid."

301
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:56,442
(laughter) Carter: No, I don't get that.

302
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:58,308
And everybody had an Uncle Earl.

303
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,308
You know, that uncle that sit around in the house

304
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:03,175
all day in his underdrawers, saying he "between" jobs.

305
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,508
To be between jobs,

306
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:06,542
you had to have had a job in the first place!

307
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:07,642
Carter: That's accurate!

308
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:09,475
And Earl got that cell phone.

309
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:11,142
He on the Sprint plan.

310
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:12,408
When the bill come, he sprint.

311
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:15,575
Carter: Yes! So many of them are delinquent in payment.

312
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,442
Rupert, move your legs.

313
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:22,542
I can see your balls.

314
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,508
Stewie, this is going to sound crazy,

315
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:26,908
but I have a theory about what's going on with Carter.

316
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,142
Really? What is it?

317
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:29,208
Well, think about it.

318
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,508
If Carter Pewterschmidt,

319
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:32,375
the dynamic chairman of Pewterschmidt Industries,

320
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,908
were to fall ill or even die,

321
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:35,475
the stock price would plummet.

322
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:37,542
I don't want you to think I'm not listening,

323
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:39,242
but when's Christmas? Not for a while.

324
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:41,308
But what I'm saying is, I think Carter is sick

325
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:44,142
or possibly even dead, and that the man we saw today

326
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:45,675
was an imposter brought in to keep

327
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:47,542
Pewterschmidt Industries' stock price up

328
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,542
and to keep people from knowing the truth.

329
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,408
Boy, you are just going to keep on talking

330
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,242
with that poppy seed stuck in your teeth, aren't you?

331
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:54,508
Anyway, what are you suggesting?

332
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:56,208
We can follow him, see if he's really Carter.

333
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,908
Okay, but I got to be home by 7:00.

334
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:59,475
I'm supposed to talk to the police

335
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:00,608
about that shooting I witnessed.

336
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,342
Good Lord, are you all right?

337
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:06,442
If I die,

338
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:09,475
leave two dollars worth of flowers right here.

339
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:12,275
Here's my fourth grade class photo.

340
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,275
Lean it against a cheap candle.

341
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,608
Well, should I call an ambulance?

342
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:17,408
No. Call Channel Nine.

343
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:20,508
And have a gap-toothed woman say, quote,

344
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,742
"He never bothered nobody."

345
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:28,575
Okay, if this guy is an imposter, he's going to have

346
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:30,142
to do everything Carter normally does.

347
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:32,375
We just have to wait and see if he slips up.

348
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,708
All right, here he comes now.

349
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,408
All right, Stu, now, if we can just...

350
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:42,608
No. What?

351
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,275
You know what you did.

352
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,575
Hey, wait a minute.

353
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:46,775
If this is an imposter,

354
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,508
then this guy we're following never had cancer.

355
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:49,842
Yeah, so?

356
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:52,142
Well, you're a dog. Can't you just sniff cancer?

357
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:53,442
No, that's just a myth we started

358
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:55,842
so we could stick our snouts in girls' boobs.

359
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,142
It's nice to have a clean bill of health.

360
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,275
Well, for now.

361
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:00,842
The key is weekly follow-ups.

362
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:03,508
You know, cervical cancer is also a problem.

363
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:05,708
My boyfriend thinks he might have prostate cancer.

364
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,242
Nope, doesn't.

365
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:14,442
Okay, now we've got him.

366
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:16,542
The real Carter would never go to a Starbucks.

367
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:19,308
He thinks they're too liberal and pretentious.

368
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:22,508
Coffee for Brent.

369
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:24,242
(snickering)

370
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:26,342
Latte for Cecil.

371
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:28,175
(snickering)

372
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,475
Beanie?

373
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,842
(laughs) None of those people are real.

374
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:34,608
I'm stealing all your sugar packets and napkins.

375
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:37,442
Woodstock's over, (bleep).

376
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:50,442
Wow. You certainly look a lot better

377
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:52,275
than that walking corpse I saw last week.

378
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,142
Well, no one's ever going to see that again,

379
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:55,275
I can promise you that.

380
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:57,242
I can't stress how important it is

381
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:58,575
our secret be kept from the public.

382
00:13:58,575 --> 00:13:59,808
I understand, sir.

383
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:02,308
And I assure you that Specimen Z

384
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,275
is secure on level 12.

385
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:05,375
Did you hear that, Brian?

386
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,308
That "walking corpse" was Carter dying of cancer.

387
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:09,808
This guy is an imposter.

388
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,408
Oh, my God.

389
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:14,175
And I bet Specimen Z is the real Carter's body.

390
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:15,475
You two didn't hear that, did you?

391
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:16,575
BRIAN: Hey, buddy, we're...

392
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,375
we're just trying to read the paper here.

393
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,242
I'll have you fired for talking to me like that.

394
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:21,408
I don't work here.

395
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:23,275
Then I'll have you killed. I want to die.

396
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:26,275
I hated that guy back there.

397
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,575
Okay, this is level 12.

398
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:32,808
There's the lab.

399
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,708
Let's get in there and find Carter's body.

400
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,308
Oh, crap, there's a keypad.

401
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,175
All right, we're just going to have to try

402
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:39,342
and figure out the code.

403
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:40,308
When's his birthday?

404
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:41,875
I think it's in March.

405
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,408
Stewie, are you crazy?

406
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:44,808
That's so loud. The guards will hear.

407
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:46,208
Don't worry about it, Bri...

408
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,842
MAN: Hey, what's going on down there?

409
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,408
Nothing.

410
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:51,142
All right.

411
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:52,642
All right, now, where would they keep

412
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,242
a dead body in a pharmaceutical lab?

413
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:56,775
(gasps) Brian, look.

414
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,442
That's it. I bet he's in there.

415
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,642
Oh, my God.

416
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:14,308
Specimen Z isn't Carter's body.

417
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:15,275
What is it?

418
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:18,175
Specimen Z is a cure for cancer.

419
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:22,775
Carter didn't die. He cured himself.

420
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:24,642
Carter: Hold it right there. (both gasp)

421
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:26,375
Damn it, Brian. You broke into my lab.

422
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,142
And you didn't wear a suit.

423
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:30,375
Hey, why didn't he have to wear a suit?

424
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,775
See what you've started now?

425
00:15:38, 41 --> 00:15:40,441
Carter, you've found a cure for cancer?

426
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42, 41
Well, I didn't come up with it.

427
00:15:42, 41 --> 00:15:43,274
A couple of eggheads I hired did.

428
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:45,174
One of them's a Chinese.

429
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:46,974
Boy, I don't like those people.

430
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:49,474
But holy crap, wind 'em up and watch 'em go.

431
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:51, 41
How long have you had this?

432
00:15:51, 41 --> 00:15:52,407
I don't know. When... when was that

433
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:53,974
"Who Let the Dogs Out?" song?

434
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:55,841
You've had this since 1999?

435
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:58,141
You know when "Who Let the Dogs Out?" came out?

436
00:15:58,141 --> 00:16:00,174
It's a song about dogs and letting them out.

437
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:02,507
I could have you arrested for breaking in here.

438
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:05, 74
Carter, you've discovered the holy grail of modern medicine.

439
00:16:05, 74 --> 00:16:07,241
Why the hell would you keep it buried like this?

440
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:08,341
I'll tell you why.

441
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:10,  7
Because there's far more money to be made

442
00:16:10,  7 --> 00:16:12,  7
in treating a disease than in curing it.

443
00:16:12,  7 --> 00:16:13,841
Why cure someone of cancer in a day

444
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:15,341
if we can treat them for a lifetime

445
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17, 41
and bill them every step along the way?

446
00:16:17, 41 --> 00:16:18,541
What? That's insane.

447
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,  7
Brian, it's so cold in here, look how big my nips are.

448
00:16:21,  7 --> 00:16:22,974
They're almost like a woman's.

449
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:26,374
Oh, look, I'm tugging at 'em and they're getting even bigger.

450
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:27,841
Carter, what you're doing here is criminal,

451
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:29,941
and I'm going to tell the whole world about it.

452
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:31,574
Is that right? Who's going to believe you?

453
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,  7
The Internet?

454
00:16:33,  7 --> 00:16:35,107
You'll be just another nut-job, left-wing blogger.

455
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:36,474
Security!

456
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:37,841
MAN: Everything's fine.

457
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:38,974
No, it isn't. Get in here.

458
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,541
Ah! Damn it! You bastards.

459
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,541
I don't know why you're surprised by this, Brian.

460
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,407
Big corporations never tell the truth.

461
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:48,474
Look at the Kleenex industry.

462
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,841
Well, we had another good quarter.

463
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:52, 41
I guess a lot of people are sneezing out there.

464
00:16:52, 41 --> 00:16:53,907
Jerry, I'm going to let you in on something,

465
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:55,874
and it can't leave this room.

466
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:56,841
Our research shows

467
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:59, 74
the primary use of our product is sperm.

468
00:16:59, 74 --> 00:17:00,174
What?

469
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:02,  7
Yeah, and brace yourself for this.

470
00:17:02,  7 --> 00:17:04,607
The second biggest use is women crying about nonsense.

471
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06, 74
But I thought sneezing was...

472
00:17:06, 74 --> 00:17:09,  7
Jerry, Jerry, it's sperm and nonsense.

473
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:12,607
I can't believe Carter

474
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:14,374
would sacrifice millions of lives

475
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:15,874
just to protect corporate profits.

476
00:17:15,874 --> 00:17:17,207
Well, don't be too upset.

477
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:18,474
Old Stewie here snagged

478
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:20,374
a little souvenir on his way out.

479
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,974
Oh, my God, Stewie.

480
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,  7
You got the cancer cure.

481
00:17:23,  7 --> 00:17:24,407
How'd you manage to steal it?

482
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26, 41
Oh, it was easy-- I just took it

483
00:17:26, 41 --> 00:17:27,441
while you guys were yammering on.

484
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:29,207
I swear, I felt like I was waiting

485
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:30,841
for Lois to get off the phone.

486
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,507
Well, that is amazing.

487
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:33,907
All right, Bonnie.

488
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:35,374
Well, it was good talking to you.

489
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:37,341
No way. She did?

490
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:38,907
When did she say that?

491
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,174
You know what?

492
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:43, 74
That doesn't surprise me. That's how she is.

493
00:17:43, 74 --> 00:17:45,341
Okay, then. Okay.

494
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,407
Okay. Okay.

495
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,341
All right, I'll see you Tuesday.

496
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:52,407
Oh, no. What happened?

497
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:54,207
(gasps) That's terrible.

498
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,841
Oh, my God, just awful.

499
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:58,907
Well, you give them my best.

500
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:00,174
Okay, I got to go.

501
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:02,307
Stewie and I are headed out to the beach.

502
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:03,874
Oh, I didn't tell you?

503
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,507
He's learning to swim.

504
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:07,841
Oh, I got him the cutest swim trunks.

505
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:09,274
At Kohl's.

506
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:11,207
You've never been to Kohl's?

507
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,207
Well, let me tell you about Kohl's.

508
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:14,474
(sighs)

509
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:16,874
All right, well, you know the mall with the Chili's?

510
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:18,107
It's across the street.

511
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:19,307
(gunshot, Bonnie shrieks)

512
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,607
Bonnie? Bonnie, are you there?

513
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:22,907
What happened? STEWIE: Let's go!

514
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:27,574
Oh, there you two are.

515
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,607
Lois, there's something incredible

516
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,974
I have to tell you.

517
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:31,107
And there's something incredible

518
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:32,407
I have to show you.

519
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:35,  7
I learned how to do a somersault.

520
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:37,541
Did I do it?

521
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,441
There he is.

522
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,541
Crap.

523
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,541
Daddy? What's going on here?

524
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,574
Brian here has stolen something very important from me.

525
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:49,  7
Give it to me, Brian.

526
00:18:49,  7 --> 00:18:50,841
Lois, your father has a cure for cancer,

527
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:52,874
but he won't release it because it's not profitable.

528
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:54,374
So I stole it.

529
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:55,907
Daddy, is this true?

530
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:57,241
Yeah. So what?

531
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:59,541
So I found the cure for cancer and didn't announce it.

532
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,274
Big deal. I also took a dump today

533
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,841
and didn't issue a press release.

534
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,441
Oh, that's interesting, because I did.

535
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:06,  7
Good for Peter.

536
00:19:06,  7 --> 00:19:08,607
It's about time the media covered something positive.

537
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,174
Daddy, you're the chairman of a billion dollar company.

538
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:12,874
You've got more money than anyone

539
00:19:12,874 --> 00:19:14,541
could ever spend in one lifetime.

540
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,407
Are you challenging me to a  Brewster's Millions?

541
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,407
Is money all that you care about?

542
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,874
What if somebody close to you got cancer?

543
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:24, 74
What if... what if the maid who raised you

544
00:19:24, 74 --> 00:19:26,907
'cause your parents were too wealthy and busy got cancer?

545
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:28,107
You mean Mamie?

546
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:30,141
Yeah. What if Mamie got cancer?

547
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:31,607
Mamie's not getting cancer!

548
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:33,107
Or how about one of us?

549
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:35,407
What if I got cancer or, God forbid,

550
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,241
one of your grandchildren?

551
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:40,574
For once in your life, do the right thing.

552
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:42,174
All right, pumpkin.

553
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:43,541
I'll do it.

554
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,307
I'll do it for you.

555
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:47,407
You will? You promise?

556
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:48,474
Yes.

557
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:49,907
I'll make the announcement tomorrow.

558
00:19:49,907 --> 00:19:51,241
Oh, Daddy.

559
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:52,307
Thank you so much.

560
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54, 41
You're my hero.

561
00:19:54, 41 --> 00:19:56,574
Oh, that's her father?

562
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,607
Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker.

563
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:03,541
Our top story: a big announcement

564
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,841
out of Pewterschmidt Pharmaceuticals today.

565
00:20:08,  7 --> 00:20:09,474
Company chairman Carter Pewterschmidt

566
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,174
released a statement announcing the launch

567
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:13,241
of a deodorant for the developmentally disabled

568
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:14,607
called Slow Stick.

569
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:18,841
It's also edible because, you know, those people...

570
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:20,907
don't, uh... don't know...

571
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,407
And now sports.

572
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:23,974
That's it? What the hell?

573
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,  7
Where's the cancer cure announcement?

574
00:20:26,  7 --> 00:20:28,841
That son of a bitch went back on his word.

575
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,474
Carter: Hello.

576
00:20:31,474 --> 00:20:33,574
Daddy, we're all sitting here in front of the TV

577
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:35,207
awaiting the big announcement.

578
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:38,474
Remember the one that's going to benefit all mankind?

579
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:41,374
The one you promised to make for me, your daughter?

580
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43, 41
I lied. (line clicks)

581
00:20:43, 41 --> 00:20:44,607
Lois, you can't stay mad at him.

582
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:46, 41
He's rich and successful.

583
00:20:46, 41 --> 00:20:47,507
It doesn't excuse what he did.

584
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:48,441
It'll be fine.

585
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,274
He'll just do a magazine cover

586
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:52,574
with a wink to who he is, and all will be forgiven.

587
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:59,441
Oh, Daddy. I know. If he's such a bad guy, why's he on a magazine?
