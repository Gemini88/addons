1
00:00:42,  0 --> 00:00:44,458
Your powers are not meant for destruction.

2
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,166
They exist to protect.

3
00:00:52, 41 --> 00:00:54,375
I'm Tatara Totsuka. What's your name?

4
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,333
A nice night out, you say?

5
00:01:06, 41 --> 00:01:08,541
Indeed, it is.

6
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,625
Mikoto...

7
00:01:14,  0 --> 00:01:15,166
Don't go!

8
00:01:22,  0 --> 00:01:23,333
Shit...

9
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,500
I was there watching it, remember?

10
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,375
Maybe you were, but I'm not really sure.

11
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,416
Don't recall.

12
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,875
I'm not in here...

13
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20, 41
Here you go!

14
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,875
Three grilled fish lunches!

15
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,166
Hey.

16
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,166
Snap out of it.

17
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,375
Let me remind you. We are not done.

18
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33, 41
Huh? With what?

19
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,625
You're still under suspicion.

20
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,916
If you aren't the murderer,

21
00:03:39, 41 --> 00:03:41,166
then someone had to have framed you.

22
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,125
Oh, I see.

23
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,166
You have a point.

24
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,333
Yay!

25
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,  0
We only stopped to eat here because you kept whining about being hungry.

26
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55, 41
Now try to behave a bit.

27
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,375
Sir, what are all these photos?

28
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,291
Oh...

29
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,  0
They're photos of my regulars.

30
00:04:18,  0 --> 00:04:19,916
They've always been posted there.

31
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,416
I don't see mine up here.

32
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,791
Really? That's strange.

33
00:04:25, 41 --> 00:04:28,208
You're one of my most regular customers.

34
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,333
Shiro...?

35
00:04:44,  0 --> 00:04:46,  0
And more soda on Thursday.

36
00:04:46, 41 --> 00:04:47,375
Thanks, 'bye.

37
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,375
I realize you're not open yet, but do you mind?

38
00:04:54, 41 --> 00:04:57, 83
How can I refuse such a beautiful lady?

39
00:04:58, 83 --> 00:05:01, 83
Besides, I hear you looked after my boys.

40
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,833
What'll you have?

41
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,  0
Lieutenant Seri Awashima of SCEPTER 4...

42
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,833
a.k.a. the Heartless Woman.

43
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:14,458
Mind not telling your boys such strange things?

44
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,666
But Seri, your heart is ice cold.

45
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,750
Martini.

46
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,416
Oui, mademoiselle.

47
00:05:23, 41 --> 00:05:24, 83
How would you like it today?

48
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:28, 41
Let's see... Four parts gin to one part vermouth.

49
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,375
And...five scoops of red bean paste, please.

50
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,333
Oui, mademoiselle.

51
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,666
That's the one thing I'll never be able to love about you, Seri.

52
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,166
What is the Red King thinking?

53
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,  0
Oh, right.

54
00:05:48,  0 --> 00:05:51,541
Sounds like our boss has been giving you guys a hard time.

55
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:57,125
You look very calm, considering your king is another king's prisoner.

56
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,166
What're you up to?

57
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,916
Hey, that's not a nice thing to say.

58
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,250
I don't understand how you can act so natural.

59
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,875
I'm sure you're aware, right?

60
00:06:08, 41 --> 00:06:09, 41
Of what?

61
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:13, 41
The Red King's Weismann level is reaching its limit.

62
00:06:15, 41 --> 00:06:17,125
You know what will happen

63
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,875
if he continues to exceed the limit, don't you?

64
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,583
You're referring to the Kagutsu Crater?

65
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,833
Now that's a disturbing thought.

66
00:06:25, 83 --> 00:06:27,125
That's how powerful a king is.

67
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,583
If they lose control,

68
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,958
there'll be changes to Japan's topography, just like last time.

69
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,208
Are you telling me you're okay with this city being blown off the map?

70
00:06:39, 41 --> 00:06:40,958
That's why he's with you...

71
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:46,208
At least you have someone who can stop him.

72
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,833
He probably wanted to get some sleep without worrying

73
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,458
about burning everything around him to the ground.

74
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,333
As far as I know, he's always been terrible

75
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,750
with stuff like self-control and patience.

76
00:07:02, 41 --> 00:07:03,541
He has no right to be a king.

77
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,375
He probably would have been happier

78
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:10, 83
if he'd been born a lion in a wide savanna somewhere.

79
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,291
You're quite sentimental, aren't you?

80
00:07:14, 41 --> 00:07:15,208
Fine.

81
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,625
We'll just do our job.

82
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,708
Thanks.

83
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,583
Those belong to one of our guys.

84
00:07:29, 41 --> 00:07:32,166
He was a guy with a lot of expensive hobbies.

85
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:36,625
Thanks to him, my bar looks like a total mess.

86
00:07:44, 83 --> 00:07:45,541
By the way, Mikoto,

87
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:50, 41
I understand that some middle school kid's been stalking you lately.

88
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53, 83
Yeah... You mean that annoying brat?

89
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,333
Hanging around you,

90
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,416
a guy who hates keeping friends, and...

91
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,833
who hates having people kiss up to him...

92
00:08:03, 41 --> 00:08:04,208
That kid's got balls.

93
00:08:05, 41 --> 00:08:06,333
HOMRA.

94
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,666
Uh, okay...

95
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,125
Thanks.

96
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,666
How should I tell you this...?

97
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,500
Tell me what?

98
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,666
It's about that kid who wants to work for you...

99
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,416
He was beaten up on the street and taken to the hospital.

100
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,  0
Hey!

101
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,708
What brings you here, King?

102
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42, 83
King?

103
00:08:43, 83 --> 00:08:44,208
Who did this to you?

104
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,208
Look, kid...

105
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:53,333
If you hang around this guy, you'll end up like this again.

106
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,291
You might think you'll be safe near someone strong,

107
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,791
but it's the exact opposite.

108
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,166
Okay, I'll be careful from now on.

109
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,166
Kid, let me say this again...

110
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,708
I asked who did this to you!

111
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15, 41
Before I tell you, King...

112
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,333
I have a huge favor to ask. Will you hear me out?

113
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,958
My foot...

114
00:09:30,  0 --> 00:09:31,625
It itches like hell!

115
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,875
Could you scratch it for me?

116
00:09:35, 41 --> 00:09:35,791
Huh?!

117
00:09:45, 41 --> 00:09:46,166
Yes!

118
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,833
Ouch!

119
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,916
You're one reckless kid.

120
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59, 41
Don't blame me if he kills you.

121
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,250
Hey, don't sweat it... It'll all work out.

122
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,  0
I'm going to become the king's vassal.

123
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,666
Huh?

124
00:10:10, 83 --> 00:10:13,125
That guy's going to become someone great.

125
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,375
He might become like a real king, don't you think?

126
00:10:29, 41 --> 00:10:29,916
You...

127
00:10:31, 83 --> 00:10:32,666
How am I supposed to read this?

128
00:10:34, 83 --> 00:10:35,875
Uh... I don't know.

129
00:10:36, 83 --> 00:10:37,625
What good is a note if you can't read it?!

130
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,625
Oh, wait, wait...

131
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,416
I'll try to remember what I was thinking when I wrote it.

132
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,500
Dammit, you...

133
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,791
Forget it.

134
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,416
It's faster if I just call and ask Kukuri.

135
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,416
What now?!

136
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,125
Why're you calling her?

137
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,125
What do you mean, why?

138
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,958
I asked her for her phone number just for this purpose.

139
00:11:04,  0 --> 00:11:05,625
You can go back and ask her directly!

140
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,583
C'mon, Shiro, let's go back!

141
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,166
Why do we need to go all the way back?!

142
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,375
What do you think we have phones for?!

143
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,625
I hate telephones!

144
00:11:17, 83 --> 00:11:17,875
Why?

145
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28, 41
Neko...?

146
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,750
What was that about?

147
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,625
Hello?

148
00:11:37, 83 --> 00:11:40,666
It's me, Isana. We're here to buy the fireworks, but...

149
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:41,958
Isana?

150
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44, 41
Do I know you?

151
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,458
What're you talking about? It's me, Yashiro Isana...

152
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,791
You know... Shiro.

153
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51, 83
Shiro?

154
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,458
I'm sorry, I don't know any Shiro.

155
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,833
I think you got the wrong number.

156
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,666
Hey, give me that.

157
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,625
What exactly happened?

158
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,833
Kukuri didn't recognize me.

159
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,  0
Says she doesn't know of any Yashiro Isana.

160
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,  0
Was that some sort of joke?

161
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,500
She didn't sound like she was joking.

162
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,416
Neko was acting strangely.

163
00:12:22, 83 --> 00:12:24,541
She might've done something to Kukuri.

164
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,208
Anyway, let's head back to the school.

165
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33, 41
Kuro...

166
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36, 83
Can I borrow your phone again?

167
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38, 83
What do you need it for?

168
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,  0
I'm going to call my home...

169
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42, 41
Why?

170
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,166
I want somebody to tell me...

171
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,125
that I'm definitely Yashiro Isana.

172
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,125
Hello? This is Yashiro...

173
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:04, 41
The number you have dialed is not in service at this time.

174
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,833
Please check the number and dial again...

175
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19, 41
Is everything okay?

176
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,583
What do you mean?

177
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,125
He looks stressed out...

178
00:13:39,  0 --> 00:13:42,208
Tonight's dinner is tom yam goong.

179
00:13:43, 83 --> 00:13:44,  0
You're here?

180
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:48,125
Of course. This is where I take my afternoon nap.

181
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,833
Thank you for your hard work.

182
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,708
What work?

183
00:13:53, 83 --> 00:13:54,875
It was just a lame scuffle.

184
00:13:55, 41 --> 00:13:57,166
Mr. Kusanagi was complaining that

185
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00, 83
you really didn't have to deal with them in person.

186
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04, 41
Why'd I have to become king, anyway?

187
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,750
I knew all along.

188
00:14:07, 41 --> 00:14:09, 83
You're different from other people.

189
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,625
I seem to attract every Tom, Dick, and Harry out there...

190
00:14:13, 83 --> 00:14:14,291
What kind of king is that?

191
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,  0
You say that,

192
00:14:16,  0 --> 00:14:19,208
but they're all important to you, aren't they?

193
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,541
One day, I'll...

194
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39, 41
Hey, don't sweat it.

195
00:14:39, 83 --> 00:14:41, 41
It'll all work out.

196
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,500
You've always been the carefree type.

197
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,166
There's nothing to be afraid of.

198
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,750
You're a king.

199
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54, 41
Your powers are not meant for destruction.

200
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,625
They exist to protect.

201
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,  0
I guarantee that.

202
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,125
What's tom yam goong?

203
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,791
You don't know?

204
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,166
It's a hot-sour soup.

205
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,458
It's bright red and looks terribly spicy,

206
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,291
but when you eat it, it has unexpectedly complex flavors.

207
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,750
It's red?

208
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,708
It sure is!

209
00:15:18, 83 --> 00:15:20,375
Anna, want to help me make it?

210
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,875
You're going to cook?

211
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,208
I'm into cooking right now...

212
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,291
When I tried calling my home,

213
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,875
I got a message saying the number wasn't in service.

214
00:15:37, 41 --> 00:15:40,458
Given that, what are the possibilities?

215
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,958
One: I called the wrong number for my house.

216
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:49,666
Two: Something happened at home that made them change their number.

217
00:15:50, 41 --> 00:15:53,666
Three: I'm lying.

218
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:59,833
Or four: There's something wrong with your memory.

219
00:16:02, 83 --> 00:16:04,208
I'm Yashiro Isana.

220
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:08, 41
An ordinary guy from a pretty happy family

221
00:16:08, 83 --> 00:16:12,208
who's now living away from his parents to attend high school.

222
00:16:15, 41 --> 00:16:17, 83
Where'd Neko go...?

223
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,333
Mr. Totsuka, you suck!

224
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,625
You did it all wrong.

225
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,916
You need to go bam! Then flip.

226
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,250
What?

227
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,  0
I can't understand what you're saying, Yata.

228
00:16:33, 83 --> 00:16:34,208
Give me that.

229
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,291
Cut it out, you guys!

230
00:16:40, 41 --> 00:16:41,625
Play with your skateboard outside!

231
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,666
Okay, Mr. Totsuka, stomp on this end hard!

232
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,541
- That guy's... - Stomp it hard.

233
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,375
- a strange dude. - Like this?

234
00:16:51,  0 --> 00:16:52,708
- You got that right. - No, not sideways.

235
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,833
- He can't fight, - Back and forth!

236
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,333
- but he seems so comfortable in the midst... - Stomp hard on the back like this!

237
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,208
- of guys who do nothing but fight. - I got it. Don't worry.

238
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,208
- He's like a wild animal trainer. - Ready...go!

239
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,250
Hey, did you just laugh?

240
00:17:08, 83 --> 00:17:09,666
You really suck at this!

241
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:14, 41
Look who's talking, Yata! You suck at Sevens!

242
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:14,875
What?!

243
00:17:15,  0 --> 00:17:16,291
What about you, Mr. Totsuka?

244
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,916
That's what happens when a guy who likes old-dude hobbies like bonsai

245
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,958
wants learn how to skateboard!

246
00:17:21,  0 --> 00:17:23,791
I enjoy trying lots of different things.

247
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26, 83
Which reminds me...

248
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,125
I bought an old-style movie camera.

249
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,166
Just take videos with your phone.

250
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,500
It just isn't the same.

251
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,750
I've been shooting a lot of clips. I'll show them to you sometime.

252
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,250
Your song.

253
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,166
Aren't you going to sing?

254
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,666
Anna's such a good kid.

255
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,666
Did you hear that?

256
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,708
There's a young lady here

257
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,875
whose heart's been captivated by one of my hobbies!

258
00:17:53, 83 --> 00:17:54,750
You're making too big a deal out of it...

259
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:06,125
At the crossroad where thousands of lives come and go every day.

260
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:11,791
That's where we met, you and I.

261
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:15,250
Those good old days

262
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:24,125
when we fooled around and laughed together...

263
00:18:30,  0 --> 00:18:33,  0
Is this where you live?

264
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35, 83
It was supposed to be here.

265
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,875
Straight down the road after we left the station.

266
00:18:39, 41 --> 00:18:41,250
A small house with a yard...

267
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,250
It appears...

268
00:18:47, 83 --> 00:18:50,291
you are not who you think you are.

269
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,125
You're right.

270
00:18:53, 41 --> 00:18:56,125
I might not be Yashiro Isana at all.

271
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:02,375
In fact, Yashiro Isana may not have existed to begin with.

272
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,  0
Yeah.

273
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,625
I had a feeling something wasn't right.

274
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:13,125
When I tried to remember details, things didn't turn out right.

275
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,583
Who are you?

276
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,500
A murderer?

277
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,916
I can't say with absolute certainty anymore, that I'm not one.

278
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,500
I can't believe myself anymore.

279
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,166
Do you want to slay me now?

280
00:19:42, 41 --> 00:19:43,125
Mr. Totsuka!

281
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,458
Mr. Totsuka!

282
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,291
Hey! What happened?!

283
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,750
The...Colorless...King...

284
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:55,916
King?

285
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,291
Mr. Totsuka!

286
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,125
Was it another king that did this to you?!

287
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,708
That's enough, Yata! Don't make him speak!

288
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,125
You'll be all right, Mr. Totsuka.

289
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,416
We sent for a doctor.

290
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,708
We'll have you fixed up in no time.

291
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,250
Hey...

292
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,416
Don't...sweat it...

293
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22, 41
It'll all work out...

294
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,375
Sorry...

295
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,  0
Mr. Totsuka?

296
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,166
Mr. Totsuka!

297
00:20:36,  0 --> 00:20:38,166
Don't fall asleep!

298
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,708
Don't do this to us! C'mon!

299
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,125
Sorry, Mikoto...

300
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,625
I have bad news.

301
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:03,833
Always being so irresponsible, and then dying on us like this...

302
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,958
Damn fool.

303
00:21:20,  0 --> 00:21:24, 41
The final curtain ls at the very moment A person gives up

304
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,375
Such wonderful words.

305
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,416
Were you listening to what I was saying?

306
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,208
You mean about not being able to believe yourself?

307
00:21:40,  0 --> 00:21:41,208
Funny you should say that.

308
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,208
I don't believe you, either.

309
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,333
That was true well before you became unable to believe yourself.

310
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,583
I believe in only one thing.

311
00:21:53, 41 --> 00:21:55,  0
My late master's words.

312
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,625
Master Ichigen said to be certain.

313
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,  0
I have not yet given up making certain.

314
00:22:02, 41 --> 00:22:04,833
That is why I have no intention of allowing the final curtain to fall.

315
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,333
What about you, Shiro?

316
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,916
Don't give up, huh?

317
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,375
You're right.

318
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,500
Your Master Ichigen speaks the truth.

319
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:25,208
In that case, I will allow you to repeat his words.

320
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:31,541
Saying Master Ichigen's blessed words will cleanse your soul.

321
00:22:35, 83 --> 00:22:35,875
Creepy.

322
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:10,916
It's me, Neko!

323
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:11,875
Guess what, guess what?

324
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:16, 41
Lots of Blue people stormed in and then, things went flash!

325
00:24:16, 83 --> 00:24:18,625
So I meowed and then,

326
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,583
the boob lady went boom, and kaboom!

327
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,875
And finally, the boss with glasses was all like...

328
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:31, 41
Next time on K, #7 "Key."

329
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:34,458
But I'm sure it'll be okay, because I have Shiro!
