00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:40,431
Hi, there.

11
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,431
Hi. I'm Cindy.

12
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:44,198
The only way I believe I'm pretty

13
00:00:44,198 --> 00:00:45,998
is if strangers have sex with me.

14
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:48,598
Well, maybe I could help fill you up with self-confidence.

15
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:49,664
Brian.

16
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,664
Hello there, sexy.

17
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:51,664
Hey, do you mind?

18
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:53,131
We were having a conversation.

19
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:56,698
My house has 8,000 square feet, zero bookshelves.

20
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:59,131
Wow, that's impressive.

21
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01, 64
I'm a writer, published twice.

22
00:01:01, 64 --> 00:01:02,998
I own a cinder block yard.

23
00:01:02,998 --> 00:01:05, 31
Have over 12,000 cinder blocks.

24
00:01:05, 31 --> 00:01:07,664
If you ever need cinder block, I can get you good price.

25
00:01:07,664 --> 00:01:08,998
Thank you.

26
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:11,731
I-I have a six-CD changer, so you can pretty much

27
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:14, 98
fill the tray and create a world.

28
00:01:14, 98 --> 00:01:15,431
Come have sex with me.

29
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:18,298
My mother will make you farkshekoosh when we are done.

30
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:20,631
Okay.

31
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:22, 98
Wait!

32
00:01:22, 98 --> 00:01:24,398
I have a time machine.

33
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:25,998
You do?

34
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27, 64
Yeah, you want to see it?

35
00:01:27, 64 --> 00:01:29,364
Yes, I want to see it!

36
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:30,664
Better luck next time, pal.

37
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,564
Some people got moves, others don't.

38
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:33,731
Been that way forever.

39
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:34,731
You.

40
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:36,998
Me. Sex.

41
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:38,564
Him legend.

42
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:45,764
Shh.

43
00:01:45,764 --> 00:01:49,331
Why do you keep a sleeping baby in your time machine room?

44
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:51,698
I-I don't know, my decorator's terrible.

45
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:55,531
(whooshing)

46
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:07,564
Where are we?

47
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:10,731
Ford's Theater, April 14, 1865.

48
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,664
Ooh, Valentine's Day.

49
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:14,164
How romantic.

50
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:17,131
Uh, yeah, sure, you know me.

51
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,331
(moaning)

52
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:19,698
(gunshot)

53
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:21, 64
(all gasping)

54
00:02:21, 64 --> 00:02:23,398
Oh, my God, the president's been shot!

55
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:25,764
If you ask me, the president's the lucky one. How's that?

56
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:28,531
He doesn't have to sit through the rest of the show.

57
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,631
(both laughing)

58
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:31,131
(gunshot)

59
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,631
(door creaks)

60
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:39,598
(murmuring)

61
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,631
Yes, I'd like to return this printer.

62
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,464
(whooshing)

63
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:48,564
HERBERT MORRISON:  The frame is crashing  to the ground,

64
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:50,631
not quite to the mooring mast!  Oh, the humanity!

65
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:52,464
And all the passengers  screaming around here!

66
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,631
And just when you thought  it couldn't get any worse,

67
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:57, 64
there's a dog having sex  with a woman!

68
00:02:57, 64 --> 00:02:59,531
Oh, I know I said,  "Oh, the humanity!" before,

69
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:01,998
but seriously, oh, the humanity  even more right now!

70
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:03,664
I mean, come on!

71
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:11,698
So that's what restaurants were like before desegregation.

72
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:14, 98
It was quiet. It  was quiet.

73
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,664
Wow, Brian, you've had quite a string

74
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:21,731
of female guests spend the night lately.

75
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,631
Yeah, whatever you're doing, it's working.

76
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:25,698
You should see the way  I have to pick up chicks.

77
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:28, 64
Hi.

78
00:03:28, 64 --> 00:03:30, 98
(giggling)

79
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:34,598
(whooshing)

80
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:37,398
Well, I guess you can call me the Man of La Muncha.

81
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:38,664
(laughs)

82
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:40,764
Hey, why does your time machine have a sticker

83
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:42,731
that says "property of Stewie Griffin?"

84
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:45,398
Uh, well, I-I...

85
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:46,998
(sighs)

86
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,464
All right, to be completely honest,

87
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:50,598
and because we've already had sex, it's not mine.

88
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,398
I use it all the time, and the owner has no idea.

89
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:55, 64
In fact, he'd kill me if he knew.

90
00:03:55, 64 --> 00:03:57,198
Really? Won't he see that thing on the control panel

91
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:58,498
that says "years traveled"?

92
00:03:58,498 --> 00:03:59,998
What thing?

93
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:05,198
Here's where Brian goes berserk.

94
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:07,198
(yelling)

95
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:12,431
(yelling continues)

96
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:19,731
(yelling winds down)

97
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:21,664
Look, it's no big deal.

98
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:23,598
Just reverse it and take off the miles.

99
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,264
That's what I do when I take my dad's car out.

100
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:28,298
Are you... are you 16?

101
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:30, 31
I will be next September.

102
00:04:30, 31 --> 00:04:31,464
Well, I think someone

103
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:34,631
has a Barnes & Noble gift card coming for their silence.

104
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,498
(groaning)

105
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:43,698
(grunts, glass breaks)

106
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:50,364
(electrical hissing)

107
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:54,364
(high-pitched chirping)

108
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:55,731
(electrical hissing)

109
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,364
Brian, what the hell are you doing in here?

110
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:01,698
What's happening to my time machine?

111
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:03, 64
I-I don't know, man.

112
00:05:03, 64 --> 00:05:04,764
I-I saw Meg leaving a minute ago,

113
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,298
going, "Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha," but I-I don't know.

114
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:09,398
(loud, droning whirring)

115
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:12,731
(whooshing, electrical hissing)

116
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,731
(explosive pop, whirring)

117
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:23,164
Oh, my God, it's having a complete meltdown!

118
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:27,298
(electrical hissing, beeps)

119
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:28,498
(loud whooshing)

120
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:30,998
(yelling)

121
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:42,998
What happened?

122
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:44,431
I don't know.

123
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:46,631
(steam hissing)

124
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:49,398
Dear God, my time machine!

125
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:53,764
You, uh... you want to tell me about this?

126
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:55,764
See? I told you. It was Meg.

127
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:57, 31
I don't think so.

128
00:05:57, 31 --> 00:05:58,764
The crotch doesn't look like a BMX track.

129
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:00,998
You bastard! You've been using my time machine

130
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:02,264
to nail your bar skanks!

131
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:03,998
Oh, come on, they're not all bad.

132
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,198
Oh, yes, I've seen the women you bring home.

133
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,331
That stutterer? She was a real prize.

134
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:10,231
How are you enjoying your meal?

135
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:14, 98
L-L-Lois, it's d-d-d-delicious.

136
00:06:14, 98 --> 00:06:15,764
Oh, for crying out loud.

137
00:06:15,764 --> 00:06:18, 64
Peter, why are you turning up the heat again?

138
00:06:18, 64 --> 00:06:20,598
Lois, this woman is obviously freezing.

139
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:22,198
Brian, I want you to tell me

140
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24, 31
exactly what you did to my time machine.

141
00:06:24, 31 --> 00:06:26,664
Well, I didn't want you to find out I'd been using it,

142
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:29,764
so I tried turning the chronological gauge backward.

143
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,598
It's not designed to go backward, Brian.

144
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,498
The question is, how am I going to fix it?

145
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:36,664
What the hell?

146
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:50,531
Dear God, everything's moving backward.

147
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:51,731
What? What are you talking about?

148
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:53,664
I don't know what the hell you did

149
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,331
with all your messing around, Brian,

150
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,564
but somehow my machine seems

151
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:58,298
to have reversed the direction of time.

152
00:06:58,298 --> 00:06:59,664
Reversed the direction of time?

153
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:01,431
Stewie, what does that even mean?

154
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:02,731
I don't get it.

155
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:08,631
Okay, now I get it.

156
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:22,564
Stewie, you can't just change the direction of time.

157
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:23,764
H-How is this even possible?

158
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:25,231
Well, clearly, when you attempted

159
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:27,164
to reverse the gauge on my time machine,

160
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:29,398
you somehow released a quantum shock wave powerful enough

161
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:31,631
to push the flow of time in the opposite direction.

162
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:35, 98
I can only surmise that you and I were isolated from its effects

163
00:07:35, 98 --> 00:07:36,664
because we were inside the machine

164
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,164
at the moment of temporal inversion.

165
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:40,164
Are you... are you sleeping?

166
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:42,264
Huh? No, no, I... No, I was listening.

167
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:44,998
What kind of jerk alters time, and then falls asleep?

168
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,131
Look, I'm sorry, Stewie, but do you think you can fix it?

169
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:50,498
Well, it's gonna take a while to rebuild the machine,

170
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:52,698
and even longer to recalibrate it for normal time,

171
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,698
but I've taken on bigger challenges before.

172
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:58,331
I had to explain to America why Heidi Klum broke up with Seal.

173
00:07:58,331 --> 00:08:00,564
Face.

174
00:08:02, 64 --> 00:08:04,631
There, now you've got a fresh new diaper, Stewie.

175
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,298
What are you talking about?

176
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:07,764
What's going on?

177
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:11, 31
I think you're getting a diaper change.

178
00:08:11, 31 --> 00:08:13,498
Aah! Get that poop-filled thing away from me!

179
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:16,564
No! Oh, God, it's cold!

180
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:19,998
Whew! Smells like somebody needs a diaper change.

181
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:20,998
Damn right I do!

182
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:22,564
Now, get this turd-filled sack off...

183
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:25, 98
Oh, my God, it just went back in my body.

184
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:28,331
Hey, look, what's wrong with Peter?

185
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:30,631
(snoring)

186
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:33,231
Oh, you smell that? He's passed out drunk.

187
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:35,564
Does no one in this house have any dignity?

188
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:37,164
(whooshing)

189
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:39,698
Hey, Lois, I'm home from the Clam, and I'm horny.

190
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:52,698
(tires squealing)

191
00:08:55, 64 --> 00:08:57,998
(tires squealing)

192
00:08:57,998 --> 00:09:00,531
Hmm. Seems like reverse time did that kid a favor.

193
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,364
I'm not so sure about that.

194
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:06,564
Stand up! You're gonna break that thermometer!

195
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:15,231
My God, it's... it's extraordinary.

196
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:16,631
They all seem to be

197
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:19,398
completely unaware that anything is amiss.

198
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:21,398
(squeaking)

199
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,398
(squeaking)

200
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:32,764
"Your trash barrels were a little close

201
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:35, 98
"to our driveway. Joe.

202
00:09:35, 98 --> 00:09:36,998
"P.S. Please close the windows

203
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:38,998
"when you're giving piano lessons.

204
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:41,698
My legs don't work, but my ears do."

205
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:46,531
Brian, what are you doing staring in Quagmire's window?

206
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:49,364
Man, watching sex in reverse is just bizarre.

207
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:02,698
God, where does Quagmire meet these women?

208
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:04,364
(moaning)

209
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:09,664
This is why Boxbuster went out of business.

210
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:11,564
Hey, what's going on over there?

211
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:16,764
(both gasp)

212
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:24, 64
My God, look at all this devastation!

213
00:10:24, 64 --> 00:10:25,164
What the hell happened?

214
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:26,398
(whoosh, chicken clucks)

215
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:29,631
(grunting)

216
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,231
(clucks) (grunts)

217
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,998
(yelling)

218
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:35, 64
(grunts)

219
00:10:35, 64 --> 00:10:38, 64
(grunting)

220
00:10:38, 64 --> 00:10:41,731
(groans)

221
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:45,698
(slow-motion groaning)

222
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:47,698
(grunting)

223
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:55,131
(high-pitched whirring)

224
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:57,131
(airplane engine whirring)

225
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:05,331
(tires squealing, thudding)

226
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,331
(grunting)

227
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:11,331
(screaming)

228
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:19,398
Okay, Seamus, today's the day

229
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:21,331
you finally ask out that barista.

230
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,198
What's the worst that could happen?

231
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:42,698
You know, that chicken's kid is in my preschool class.

232
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:44,764
I don't really want to be friends with him,

233
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:46,198
but he knows a lot of chicks.

234
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:47,998
And backwards rim shot.

235
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,664
(backwards rim shot)

236
00:11:52, 64 --> 00:11:55, 64
Oh, Brian, this is gonna be more difficult than I thought.

237
00:11:55, 64 --> 00:11:57, 98
Damn it, I hate these new stairs!

238
00:11:57, 98 --> 00:11:59, 98
(screaming)

239
00:11:59, 98 --> 00:12:01,631
(bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep)

240
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:03, 64
(thumping, bleep)

241
00:12:03, 64 --> 00:12:04,998
What are you watching?

242
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:06,464
Meet the Press; it's really weird.

243
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:09,298
In reverse time, the Republicans make outrageous statements

244
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:12, 31
and then the host asks an unrelated question.

245
00:12:12, 31 --> 00:12:13,664
Global warming is a myth.

246
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:17, 64
God created everything, and the world is getting colder!

247
00:12:17, 64 --> 00:12:19,631
What is your tax plan?

248
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:20,998
That's odd.

249
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:21,664
What?

250
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:27, 98
Man, we got a large number of clovers on our lawn.

251
00:12:27, 98 --> 00:12:30,698
No, no, no, no, no, no!

252
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:32,698
Oh, hey, Cleveland.

253
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,598
Australia, here I come.

254
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:39,698
Look at that, Brian.

255
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:41,731
Cleveland is back living across the street.

256
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:43,698
Cleveland left Quahog quite some time ago,

257
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:46,298
yet we only just recently entered reverse time.

258
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,764
So what does that mean?

259
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:50,764
Well, it suggests that time may not simply be flowing backwards;

260
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:52,698
it may, in fact, be accelerating.

261
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:54,498
Accelerating? Why would that be happening?

262
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:55,631
I'm not sure.

263
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:56,698
Have you ever heard of a phenomenon

264
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:58,464
called time dilation, Brian?

265
00:12:58,464 --> 00:12:59,531
Sure. No, you haven't.

266
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,364
Time dilation, in forward time,

267
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,264
is a phenomenon caused by a variety of factors

268
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:05,498
in which time moves more slowly.

269
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,464
In reverse time, it stands to reason

270
00:13:07,464 --> 00:13:09,631
that the same phenomenon would cause time to accelerate.

271
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:11,731
I'll have to consult my quantum calculations

272
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:14,398
to try to isolate the factors responsible.

273
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,631
What the hell was that?

274
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,731
This is more intense than when I fought a rabbit

275
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,164
in that karate tournament.

276
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:24,998
That's weird. You're doing reverse cutaways now?

277
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:27, 64
What the hell is... (screams) What? What's the matter?

278
00:13:31, 64 --> 00:13:33,431
Dear God, I'm un-teething.

279
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,664
Brian, it appears the flow of reverse time

280
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:37,331
is beginning to affect us as well.

281
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:38,664
What does that mean?

282
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:41,231
It means I'm going to have to relive everything.

283
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:43,298
Every painful, awkward moment.

284
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:45,364
Like that time I forgot what came after "G"

285
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:46,731
and had to fake it.

Oh, God, it's not gonna be coming out of us;

302
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:28,698
it's gonna be going... (vomit noise)

309
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:46, 31
Oh, God, this is so disgusting.

310
00:14:46, 31 --> 00:14:48,598
I think I'm gonna puke.

We have got to fix this.

315
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:02, 31
We just ate so much vomit.

316
00:15:02, 31 --> 00:15:04,264
Brian, it gets worse.

317
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:06, 31
Look.

318
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:10,398
Yeah, Bonnie's pregnant with Susie. So?

319
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:12,664
That means Susie's been un-born.

320
00:15:12,664 --> 00:15:14,298
Oh, my God.

321
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:16,231
Stewie, you're not that much older than Susie.

322
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:18,231
Brian, if we don't find a way

323
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:19,698
to push time forward again soon,

324
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:23,264

With the time acceleration, I'm not quite sure.

331
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,524
But trust me, I can feel myself getting younger.

332
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:56,391
All right.

333
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,491
The machine has been repaired.

334
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,557
Now all I've got to do is isolate the cause

335
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:00,657
of the acceleration curve

336
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:02,791
and see if I can duplicate the shock wave.

337
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04, 24
(screams)

338
00:16:04, 24 --> 00:16:05,391
What's the matter?

339
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:07,791
I've regressed to my pre-ambulatory stage.

340
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,524
I can no longer walk!

341
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:11,824
(grunting)

342
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:14,357
My God, Stewie, you look terrible.

343
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:15,924
Brian, I suddenly feel as if

344
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:18,991
I've just been through some sort of major trauma.

345
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:22,291
Uh-oh. I think I know what that major trauma was.

346
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24, 57
(gasps) My birth.

347
00:16:24, 57 --> 00:16:25,857
Dear God, I've got to get out of here!

348
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:28,891
(gasps)

349
00:16:32, 57 --> 00:16:33,757
Oh, he's so cute.

350
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:35,757
Oh, my God, we're getting closer to the beginning.

351
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:37,457
You're Lacey Chabert.

352
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:38,991
Oh, boy, a baby.

353
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:41,857
I saw my Spanish teacher leave one of you in a trash can.

354
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:43,324
Brian, help!

355
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:44,924
Stewie, what do I do?

356
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:47,324
He's gorgeous, isn't he?

357
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:49,391
I want to be the baby!

358
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,891
Look at that head.

359
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:52,591
Well, Lois, this kind of completes

360
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,557
your little carnival here.

361
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:55,691
Hey, little guy.

362
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:57,557
You ever need white, corner-of-the-mouth stuff,

363
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:59,724
you come to your grandpa.

364
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:02,924
Stewie, this is your new home.

365
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:04,424
Brian, help! It's up to you.

366
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:07, 57
You've got to restore the flow of time.

367
00:17:07, 57 --> 00:17:09,524
My life depends on it!

368
00:17:10,824 --> 00:17:13, 57
What? Stewie, I don't know how to fix that machine.

369
00:17:13, 57 --> 00:17:14,424
Trust me, you can do it.

370
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,524
You're so talented in so many ways.

371
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:17,524
Like what?

372
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:19, 24
Like... You...

373
00:17:19, 24 --> 00:17:20,691
Just write down however you think you're talented,

374
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,424
and I'll sign it.

375
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:25,991
Well, it's up to you, buddy.

376
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:28,324
Save this marriage.

377
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:36,891
Oh, my God, it's the greased-up deaf guy

378
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,491
running backwards toward that grease truck explosion.

379
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,591
Oh, the grease burns so bad!

380
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,291
I can't hear!

381
00:17:45, 57 --> 00:17:47, 57
(in deeper voice): Boy, I am late for that meeting.

382
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:53,757
Come on, math, you dick.

383
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:59,424
Come on, Brian.

384
00:18:05, 57 --> 00:18:06,457
(machine whirring)

385
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:07,491
All right, think, think.

386
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:09,391
What do I do? What do I do?

387
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:11,557
All right, could it be as simple as this?

388
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,957
"Invert time flow."

389
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:15,657
Ah-ah-ah.

390
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:16,824
Ah-ah-ah.

391
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:18,391
Ah-ah-ah.

392
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:21,857
Oh, he's perfect.

393
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:24,857
Time of birth: 11:34 a.m.

394
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:26,491
Come on, Brian, hurry.

395
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:27,991
(cheering)

396
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:29,424
It's a girl!

397
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:31,391
With a penis and no vagina.

398
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,824
No...!

399
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,424
I think I can hear the ocean.

400
00:18:38,424 --> 00:18:40,291
Smell it, too.

401
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,424
All right, what do I do?

402
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,691
Wait a minute, what did I do before?

403
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,391
That's all I have to do, right,

404
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:48,324
is duplicate the circumstances, but do it the opposite way.

405
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:49,924
All right, I was standing right here,

406
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:53,357
the machine was on, I broke the glass...

407
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:55,324
and I turned the gauge backward.

408
00:18:55,324 --> 00:18:57,791
Maybe if I turn it in the other direction.

409
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:02,291
(electrical buzzing)

410
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:24,357
Ooh, a quarter.

411
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:26,757
Who cares what that doctor found on my nuts?

412
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:28,824
This is a good day.

413
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:29,991
It worked.

414
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:31,724
I don't believe it. It worked.

415
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:38,357
Brian, there you are.

416
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:39,391
Where have you been?

417
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,691
Meg, where's Stewie?

418
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:42,424
Stewie? Who's Stewie?

419
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:43,891
Here it comes. Push, Mrs. Griffin.

420
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45, 24
(groaning)

421
00:19:45, 24 --> 00:19:46,691
You know what?

422
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:49,491
I take it back, those panties are gonna be in the way.

423
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:51, 57
Okay, here comes the baby.

424
00:19:51, 57 --> 00:19:52,624
(groaning)

425
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,424
Bloody hell!

426
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:55,591
It's a boy.

427
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,824
(cheering) Oh, thank God.

428
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:00,324
Oh, he's so beautiful.

429
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,424
Mrs. Griffin, your husband's standing right here.

430
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:04,724
What should we name him?

431
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:07,557
I kind of like Brian's name: Stewie.

432
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:09,557
That's a wonderful name, Brian.

433
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:10,791
Stewie.

434
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,724
Hi, Stewie.

435
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:14, 57
You did it, Brian. I've got to say,

436
00:20:14, 57 --> 00:20:16,457
I didn't think you were gonna be able to pull it off,

437
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:17,757
but you did it.

438
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:19,824
You saved my life.

439
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:22,657
And for that, I shall be forever grateful.

440
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:25,957
Hey, I couldn't imagine life without you, buddy.

441
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:29,324
You know, I forgot what a man cave I had in Lois's uterus.

442
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:31, 24
While I was waiting for you, I was shooting pool.

443
00:20:31, 24 --> 00:20:34,291
Had to hold the cue at weird angles, but still.

444
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:40,791
Oh, Peter, isn't he amazing?

445
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,857
Is he smart, or is he... like me?

446
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:45,857
He's perfect.

447
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:55,691
CHRIS:  You guys heard the baby

448
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57, 24
talking in there, didn't you?

449
00:20:57, 24 --> 00:20:58,791
LOIS:  Chris, that's ridiculous.
