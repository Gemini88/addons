00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,961
Oliver: My name is Oliver Queen.

3
00:00:11, 44 --> 00:00:13,588
To my family, I am the brother and son

4
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:17,801
who just returned home after being lost at sea 5 years ago.

5
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:20,512
They don't know I came back with a mission,

6
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:23,265
to bring justice to our city,

7
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:27,436
and they never can.

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,608
The men and women I've targeted are dangerous, corrupt,

9
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:36,528
a virulent cancer.

10
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:40,949
Cancers like James Holder,

11
00:00:41, 33 --> 00:00:44,578
whose corporation put defective smoke detectors

12
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:47,831
in low-Income housing in the glades.

13
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:53,879
There have been many fires and too many funerals.

14
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:01,291
But cancers can be fought and conquered.

15
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:04,920
All it takes is a surgeon...

16
00:01:05,  3 --> 00:01:07,464
And the right instrument.

17
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:13,845
Heh.

18
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:15,847
Other than the bill I got handed

19
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:17,307
this morning by my legal team,

20
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,225
I'm feeling pretty good.

21
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:20,185
Plus, now that this lawsuit's been settled,

22
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:23,813
we can focus our attention on unidac industries.

23
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:25,941
[chuckles] Ok.

24
00:01:26, 24 --> 00:01:28,652
I'll see you in the office first thing.

I have armed security inside.

28
00:01:38,453 --> 00:01:40,121
All I have to do is call out.

29
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:41,456
Go ahead.

30
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:43,833
They can't hear you.

31
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:46,962
What the hell do you want?

32
00:01:47, 45 --> 00:01:49,714
How many people died in those fires?

33
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:52,551
How many?!

34
00:01:54, 52 --> 00:01:57,138
The courts say you don't owe your victims anything.

35
00:01:57,222 --> 00:01:59,516
I disagree.

36
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,767
James Holder...

37
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,977
you--

Oliver: It's no surprise a man as corrupt as James Holder

42
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:51,359
has more than one enemy.

43
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:15,133
The bullet. Poison.

44
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:30,273
Ahh.

00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:56, 91

What happened? Thea ok?

58
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,142
The cops brought her home.

59
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:49,144
Her and some of her friends broke into a store,

60
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:51,187
tried on some dresses last night.

61
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:55,984
Lit up the breathalyzer like a christmas tree.

62
00:04:56, 67 --> 00:04:58, 69
So how was your evening, sir?

63
00:04:58,153 --> 00:04:59,905
You mean after I said I had to go to the bathroom

64
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:01,239
at dinner and never came back?

65
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:06,745
I guess from now on I'll be watching you pee.

66
00:05:09,164 --> 00:05:12,208
Thank you, officers. My wife and I appreciate it.

67
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:14,544
I'll see you out.

68
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:20,217
Last time it was public intoxication.

69
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,426
This time breaking and entering.

70
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,387
My, how we are moving up in the criminal world.

71
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:26,848
You know, when you pay off the store owner,

72
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:28,725
you should check out the merchandise.

73
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:30,727
They got some pretty killer outfits.

74
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,270
Thea, go get ready for school.

75
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:37, 67
Uh, you know, I was thinking of taking a sick day.

76
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,322
Fine, then get some sleep.

77
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,286
You look like crap.

78
00:05:49, 79 --> 00:05:50,747
You're letting her play hooky?

79
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,332
When your sister gets like this,

80
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:54,125
it's best to give her her space.

81
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,293
She's testing you.

82
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:59,214
Yes. Who'd she learn that from?

83
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:01,341
Mom.

84
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:04,719
When I was her age, you and dad let me get away with murder.

85
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:07,681
Looking back, I could have used less space

86
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:10,183
and more parenting.

87
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,109
It doesn't make sense.

88
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,778
Holder fits the profile. Wealthy dirtbag.

89
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,280
Red meat for the Hood.

90
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:24,614
And we recovered at least one arrow.

91
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,491
Yeah, only this time the cause of death

92
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:27,701
is a double tap through the heart

93
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:29,244
and our perp doesn't use firearms.

94
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:31,538
Maybe he's finally figured out there's easier ways

95
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:33,540
to kill people than with a bow and arrow.

96
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:38,587
It's like you said, the guy's a whackjob.

97
00:06:57, 22 --> 00:06:59,691
Oliver: The bullets were laced with curare,

98
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:01,943
a rare and deadly poison,

99
00:07:02, 27 --> 00:07:06, 31
the killer's unique m.O.

100
00:07:06,114 --> 00:07:07,824
He's killed all over the world--

101
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:10,869
Chicago, markovia, corto maltese.

102
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:13,997
Interpol even has a codename for him--

103
00:07:14, 80 --> 00:07:16,416
deadshot.

104
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,668
I was prepared to give James Holder a chance

105
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:23,215
to right his wrongs, but this deadshot has no morality,

106
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:26,468
no honor, no code.

107
00:07:26,551 --> 00:07:28,261
He doesn't kill for justice,

108
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:31,514
which makes him as dangerous as anyone on my list.

109
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,542
In fact, it puts him right at the top.

110
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:50,992
So what do you think?

111
00:07:51, 76 --> 00:07:52,327
Great spot for a nightclub or what?

112
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,621
Sweet. Though I got to tell you, man,

113
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,289
if you're thinking about calling it queens,

114
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:58,250
I don't think you're gonna get the clientele

115
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,334
that you were hoping for.

116
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,335
Private office.

117
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:02,879
For the private one-on-one meetings, I would imagine.

118
00:08:02,963 --> 00:08:05,715
Hopefully the occasional two-on-one meeting.

119
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,133
[laughs]

120
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:09, 10
Man, are you sure you want to do this?

121
00:08:09, 94 --> 00:08:11,763
It's not like you really have any experience

122
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:16, 59
in running a...well, running anything.

123
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,603
How about tomorrow night the two of us,

124
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,813
we go and scope out the competition.

125
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,606
There's a new club opening downtown.

126
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,359
It's called poison. Max Fuller owns it.

127
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:26,152
Max Fuller? Mm-hmm.

128
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:27,946
I slept with his fiancee.

129
00:08:28, 29 --> 00:08:28,947
Yeah, before the wedding.

130
00:08:29, 30 --> 00:08:30,198
It was at the rehearsal dinner.

131
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:33,285
The rehearsal dinner is technically before the wedding.

132
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:34,119
[laughs] right?

133
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:36,830
And besides, who stays mad at a castaway?

134
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:39,165
Ah, dammit, I got to roll.

135
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:41,126
Anyway, I'll see you later, man.

136
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,377
Good place.

137
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,421
See you.

138
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:49,593
So... what do you think?

139
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:52,470
Well, I'm here to provide security, sir, not a commentary.

140
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:54,389
Oh, come on, dig, do me a favor.

141
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:58,226
Speak freely, please.

142
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,353
Well, this is the glades, right?

143
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:04,149
Your rich white friends wouldn't come to this neighborhood on a bet.

144
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:05,442
I am Oliver Queen, right?

145
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:09,571
People would stand in line for 3 hours if I opened a club.

146
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:11,406
And no one who actually lives in the glades

147
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:13, 33
would see a penny of those cover charges.

148
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:14,659
So we make it a successful business,

149
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,411
we gentrify the neighborhood.

150
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:19,623
I was wondering when we would get to that.

151
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:23,543
The white Knight swooping in to save the disenfranchised.

152
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:27,797
And all by his lonesome with No help from anybody.

153
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:28,715
Wow.

154
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:30,967
You don't think very much of me, do you?

155
00:09:31, 51 --> 00:09:34,221
No, sir, actually, I have a very high regard

156
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:37,390
for how perceptive you are.

157
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,310
Sir.

158
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,484
Oliver: The nightclub will conceal my base underneath

159
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:52,530
and provide an alibi for where Oliver Queen spends his nights.

160
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:02, 40
Hey.

161
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,625
Do you have the depos on the jergens case?

162
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,295
Yeah, they're around here somewhere.

163
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:12,133
I was just surfing the 'net.

164
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:12,717
Really?

165
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:15,804
Joanna, I'm over him. [scoffs]

166
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:17,472
and you don't believe me.

167
00:10:17,556 --> 00:10:20,475
Well, I would have if I wouldn't have just caught you

168
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,685
trolling for articles on him!

169
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,520
I wasn't trolling! I don't want to have

170
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:27,440
to be the one to remind you that he cheated on you, Laurel.

171
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:28,900
With your sister.

172
00:10:28,984 --> 00:10:31,403
I appreciate your self control.

173
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,572
You're stuck in the past. And the reason I know this

174
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:35,782
is the fact that the only physical relationship

175
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:39,286
you've had since Oliver is with his best friend.

176
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:41,454
It is time to move on.

177
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:43,540
It is past time.

178
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,500
I've been busy.

179
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:46,918
I work a lot.

180
00:10:47,  2 --> 00:10:48,461
Ok.

181
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:49,421
That's got to stop.

182
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:50,839
So we are going out tonight.

183
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:52,507
And--and we are going to have some shots

184
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,259
and we are going to dance with men that we don't know

185
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:57,137
and we are going to stay out way too late.

186
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,389
Oh! [chuckles]

187
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,224
jergens depos.

188
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,768
I really don't think I can go out tonight.

189
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:10, 66
It is adorable that you actually think I'm giving you a choice.

190
00:11:15, 71 --> 00:11:18,366
I want you to come home right after school.

191
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,536
Oh, can't. Margot and I are going to go to the mall.

192
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,247
What, more shopping? [chuckles]

193
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:25,916
tell Margot you'll have to cancel.

194
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,543
You're grounded for two weeks.

195
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:30,420
Grounded?

196
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:32, 88
I've never been grounded.

197
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:35,  8
Well, you've never committed larceny before.

198
00:11:35, 91 --> 00:11:37,677
Since when do you care?

199
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:39,554
I've always cared. I'm your mother.

200
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:43,558
Look, we've had a good thing going on the last five years.

201
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:44,559
Why mess with that now?

202
00:11:44,643 --> 00:11:46,394
No, we are paying off store owners

203
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:47,437
to keep your record clean,

204
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,897
so clearly, it hasn't been working.

205
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,899
And you're going to teach me.

206
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:53,568
[scoffs] it's Oliver, isn't it?

207
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:56,529
His judgmental hypocrisy is rubbing off on you.

208
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:59,574
No, I don't need Oliver to teach me how to parent you.

209
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:01,576
You'll be home by 4:00.

210
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,911
Or what?

211
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:05,580
You're going to call the cops on me?

212
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:09,292
Tell them I say hi.

213
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34, 67
[gunshots]

214
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:19,195
got ballistics back on the Holder murder.

215
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,949
They pulled two 7.62 millimeter bullets out of him.

216
00:13:23, 33 --> 00:13:25,160
According to the stippling and size of the entry wound,

217
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:26,536
they estimate the shots were fired

218
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,663
from approximately a hundred yards away.

219
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:29,789
[chuckles] a hundred yards?

220
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:32,709
What, so the Hood shoots him from another building,

221
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,252
goes over to his place, he takes out his security,

222
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:36,630
and then he fires off a few arrows?

223
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:38, 48
And according to his tox screen,

224
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:39,758
his blood contained high concentrations

225
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:41,718
of strychnos toxifera.

226
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:43,136
What? Curare.

227
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44, 95
It's a kind of poison.

228
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:46,181
Oh. Ok, so now we switch from arrows

229
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:48, 58
to sniper bullets and poison.

230
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:49,935
I'm not buying it.

231
00:13:50, 18 --> 00:13:52,604
We still found arrows on the scene.

232
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:54, 64
Solid evidence the Hood was there.

233
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,233
[sighs] where you going?

234
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:59,694
I'm going to get my own evidence.

235
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:03,531
[sighs]

236
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:14,542
Oliver: 7.62 millimeter rounds.

237
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:17,712
The money trail leads back to the bratva--

238
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,381
The Russian mob.

239
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:23,718
Finally... Some good luck.

240
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:03,466

00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:48, 94
Pleased to meet you.

245
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:54,184
I apologize.

246
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,686
We meant no disrespect

247
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,439
to a captain.

248
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:03,610
Particularly an american one.

249
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:06,196
[clears throat]

250
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,822
so...

251
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:10,158
how can I be of assistance?

252
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:12, 77
I'm in the market for a hired gun.

253
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,828
Someone the organization's used before.

254
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:18,458
His calling card is a 7.62 millimeter gun laced with curare.

255
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,835
I know no man Who uses such tools.

256
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,837
But you can find out who does.

257
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:25,840
First, we will drink to each other's health,

258
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:30,887
then I will look into the identity of this man you seek.

259
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:33,640
Ahh.

260
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:37,852
I will also confirm that you are really bratva captain.

261
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:40,105
Should this not be the case,

262
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:42,440
I will send my mechanic here

263
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:46,319
to find you and kill you and your family.

264
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:53,868
Man on TV: Carl Rasmussen was found

265
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:56,162
shot to death in his home earlier this evening.

266
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:58,665
The police will not comment if there's a connection

267
00:16:58,748 --> 00:16:59,874
between Mr. Rasmussen's death

268
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02, 43
and the murder of James Holder a few nights ago.

269
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:07, 48
Mr. Rasmussen leaves behind a wife and three children.

270
00:17:26, 26 --> 00:17:27,777
It's a great loss.

271
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:28,528
Carl was a titan.

272
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:32,532
A titan who was looking to buy out a company called

273
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:33,241
unidac industries?

274
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:34,910
Well, industries are something of a misnomer.

275
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:39,915
Ui's recent activity was actually looking into alternative energy.

276
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:41,917
I think the point my partner is trying to make

277
00:17:42,  0 --> 00:17:43,126
is that Carl Rasmussen was

278
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:45,503
the second bidder this week to lose his life.

279
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:46,922
Are you implying something, detective?

280
00:17:47,  5 --> 00:17:49,466
Well, only that your husband's looking into buying unidac industries

281
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,552
and the competition seems to be dropping like flies.

282
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,930
And I'm sure your veiled accusation

283
00:17:55, 13 --> 00:17:58,808
has nothing to do with how you feel about my family?

284
00:17:58,892 --> 00:17:59,684
[Scoffs]

285
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:01,436
unidac's in receivership, detective.

286
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,437
Ownership is subject

287
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,940
to a liquidation auction, so that means there are

288
00:18:05, 23 --> 00:18:06,524
many prospective buyers.

289
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:09, 27
And the auction's tomorrow, so...

290
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,946
if I was taking out the competition,

291
00:18:11, 29 --> 00:18:13,990
I have a lot of killing to do in a very short amount of time.

We're just making the rounds with the interested buyers.

Let them know to be careful.

294

Oh, yes. And I'm overwhelmed

I have never seen this guy before in my life.

and he sat you down and he explained to you

that the cat was in fact a tiger

00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:55,710
Do you know what of?

504
00:30:55,794 --> 00:30:58, 88
The exchange building. Never heard of it.

505
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:02,717
It's where the unidac industry's auction is scheduled to take place.

506
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:05,845
I thought you said that was your laptop.

507
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:06,721
Yes.

508
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:09, 57
Look, I don't want to get in the middle

509
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,727
of some shakespearian family drama thing.

510
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:13,728
What?

511
00:31:13,812 --> 00:31:15,730
Mr. Steele marrying your mom.

512
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:18,567
Claudius, Gertrude...

513
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,734
Hamlet?

514
00:31:19,818 --> 00:31:21,820
I didn't study Shakespeare at any of the four schools

515
00:31:21,903 --> 00:31:23,780
that I dropped out of.

516
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:27,284
Mr. Steele is trying to buy unidac industries.

517
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,452
And you've got a company laptop

518
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,747
associated with one of the guys he's competing against.

519
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:35,750
Floyd Lawton. No.

520
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,752
Warren Patel.

521
00:31:37,836 --> 00:31:40,755
Who's Floyd Lawton?

522
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,258
He is an employee

523
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:46,428
of Mr. Patel, evidently.

524
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50, 83
Oliver: The exchange building

525
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:53,128
is surrounded by 3 towers with eye lines into the building.

526
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,796
Lawton could get a kill shot off

527
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,716
from virtually anywhere.

528
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:01,178
But I can't cover the area.

529
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:03,680
I can't protect all of deadshot's targets.

530
00:32:03,764 --> 00:32:07,517
I can't do this alone.

ah, you son of a bitch! Detective, quiet!

533
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:17,819
You've got a pair on you, pulling this right outside the police station!

534
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,571
Floyd Lawton's the one targeting the buyers

535
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:20,822
interested in unidac industries.

536
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:24,451
Interpol calls him "Deadshot" Because he never misses.

537
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:27,454
You can look this up after I go.

538
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:29,831
Yeah, and stop chasing you, I suppose?

539
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,833
Warren Patel hired Lawton.

540
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,166
I can't be sure who they're targeting,

541
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,209
it might be all the buyers,

542
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:37,296
and I can't protect them in a space that big.

543
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:39,840
I need your help.

544
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:41,174
[chuckles] Yeah?

545
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:42,301
Professional help.

546
00:32:42,384 --> 00:32:45,178
Lawton laces his bullets with curare.

547
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:47,514
Tell your men to wear kevlar.

548
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:50,767

[indistinct chatter]

551

Well, it's quite a turn out, huh?

552
00:33:14,  0 --> 00:33:16,378
Well, it's quite an opportunity, actually.

553
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,548
But regardless of the outcome of the auction,

554
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:22,759
I'm already a winner because I have the two most beautiful women

555
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:24,135
at my side tonight. Two?

Mm-hmm.

00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,502
Thanks for coming, Thea.

It means a lot to your mother. And me.

559
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:39,801
Mr. Steele, the auction

560
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,677
will be opening in 5 minutes.

561

Please make sure your bid is ready.

[indistinct chatter]

Warren Patel. I'm going to need you to come with me, sir.

566
00:33:53, 64 --> 00:33:55,692
Unit one, all clear. Unit two, you copy?

567
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:59,445
Man: We have Patel in custody. Still, no sign of Lawton.

568
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:00,697
Unit three? Woman: Unit three--

569
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,616
I'm at the northwest perimeter. All clear.

570
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,409
Unit four?

571
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:05,702
Second MAN: Parking structure is clear.

572
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:06,953
Unit five, what's your status?

573
00:34:07, 36 --> 00:34:10,915
This is unit five. All clear.

574
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,633
Oh, what a shock.

575
00:34:20,717 --> 00:34:23,386
It is Friday night.

576
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,721
What are you doing here?

577
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:26,764
Well, I am an attorney and This is a courthouse,

578
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:30,935
so I think the better question is, what are you doing here?

579
00:34:31, 19 --> 00:34:33,896
I wanted to talk to you about last night.

580
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,274
You mean how I saved your asses?

581
00:34:36,357 --> 00:34:37,358
You're welcome.

582
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,194
Ok, first of all, we shall never,

583
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,529
ever speak of that ever again.

584
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:45,450
And secondly, I think you know that I meant the other thing.

585
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,744
I don't care to talk about that.

586
00:34:47,827 --> 00:34:49,537
I spoke to Oliver.

587
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:54,250
He was surprisingly cool.

588
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:58, 46
That's because he knew.

589
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,757
Did you see his face When Thea told him?

590
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,760
Tommy, he didn't even blink.

591
00:35:03,843 --> 00:35:05,511
Trust me, he knew.

592
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:07,764
Then why didn't he say anything?

593
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:08,723
I don't know.

594
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:13, 61
Maybe because he knows he doesn't have any right to judge me.

595
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,397
There's a silver lining, though.

596
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18, 66
Now that the whole truth

597
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,525
and nothing But is out,

598
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:23,529
is there a chance now for you and me?

599
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:29,952
You said you didn't think

600
00:35:30, 36 --> 00:35:32,705
that I was a one girl type of guy.

601
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:34,999
I'm going to prove you wrong.

602

By dating me.

603
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39, 87
By being better.

604

By being someone that you deserve
