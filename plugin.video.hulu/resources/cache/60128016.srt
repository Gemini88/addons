1
00:02:26, 83 --> 00:02:28,750
Pizza delivery.

2
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,916
Uh... This is a...pizza.

3
00:02:37, 41 --> 00:02:38,166
Okay, go.

4
00:02:43, 41 --> 00:02:44,875
It's a go, Yata.

5
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,250
- Yo! - Yo!

6
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,333
You're here too early, Mikoto.

7
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,333
Says he doesn't know.

8
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28, 83
I see... Let's go.

9
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31, 41
- Fuck this guy. - All this action made me hungry...

10
00:04:31, 83 --> 00:04:31,666
See you.

11
00:04:45, 83 --> 00:04:46,583
We have enough personnel.

12
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48, 83
- Keep the others out. - Roger that.

13
00:04:53,  0 --> 00:04:54,375
They're on the floor above!

14
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,166
It's those Blues!

15
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,958
SCEPTER 4 has entered the building.

16
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,166
What should we do, Mikoto?

17
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:32,916
Burn them.

18
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,833
Oh yeah!

19
00:05:35,  0 --> 00:05:36,208
Let's do it, guys!

20
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,375
- Yeah! - Yeah!

21
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,291
No blood! No Bone! No Ash!

22
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05, 41
The Third King, Mikoto Suoh is activating his sanctum.

23
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,291
Weismann level at 75, 80...

24
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Vertical over!

25
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,666
Here it comes... The Sword of Damocles.

26
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,541
It's huge!

27
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,458
Very well...

28
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,833
We will advance with swords in hand!

29
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,708
For our cause is pure!

30
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,375
Men! Draw your swords!

31
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,375
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

32
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,  0
- Akiyama, ready! - Benzai, ready!

33
00:06:40, 41 --> 00:06:41,791
- Kamo, ready! - Domyoji, ready!

34
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,  0
- Enomoto, ready! - Fuse, ready!

35
00:06:43, 41 --> 00:06:44,833
- Goto, ready! - Hidaka, ready!

36
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47, 83
Munakata, ready!

37
00:09:02, 83 --> 00:09:04, 83
Arriving now at track two,

38
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:08,125
the 8:05 bound for Ashinaka High School campus.

39
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,958
Please stand clear of the doors.

40
00:09:35, 83 --> 00:09:39,625
I'm sure you are all busy preparing for the upcoming school festival.

41
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,166
But please refrain from getting carried away with the festivities,

42
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,291
and remember to uphold the tradition

43
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,625
and honor of this school.

44
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:07,750
Die!

45
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19, 83
Listen, I forgot to bring my lunch today.

46
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,500
Don't lie!

47
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22, 41
- Can I have some of yours? - No!

48
00:10:22, 83 --> 00:10:23,833
- About Shiro... - I don't think so.

49
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,  0
Not today!

50
00:10:25, 41 --> 00:10:26, 41
Shiro...?

51
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,208
- Don't you ever get tired of asking? - You mean Yashiro Isana?

52
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,416
Does he have any friends?

53
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:32,500
What?

54
00:10:33, 83 --> 00:10:33,916
No...

55
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,125
The guy seems pretty popular to me.

56
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,416
- Whoops! - A joker to be exact.

57
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,750
- But when you think about it... - Here you go.

58
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,  0
- He's not really - Thanks!

59
00:10:44,  0 --> 00:10:46,  0
- close with anyone... - Thank you!

60
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,  0
Oh yeah, and he's not eating enough veggies.

61
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,416
Veggies?

62
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,916
- His diet is leaning towards - Here!

63
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,166
too much meat consumption,

64
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,166
because he only goes after the main dishes.

65
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57, 41
So, today...

66
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,375
I'm going to fix that by giving him this nutritionally balanced

67
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,833
combination of nimono, salad, and cooked veggies!

68
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,333
Huh?

69
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,291
Oh no, he's leaving!

70
00:11:09,  0 --> 00:11:09,833
He's gone.

71
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,  0
Where'd he go?!

72
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,458
- Want some? - Yes, please!

73
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,708
You want mine too?

74
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,375
Gimme!

75
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,208
- Here you go. - I have some for you too!

76
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:25,958
I'm all yours!

77
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,  0
Hey, there's some over here too!

78
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,166
- Thanks! - Here!

79
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:29,791
Take it.

80
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,166
- Let's go! - Right!

81
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,541
You again?

82
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,791
That scared me!

83
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54, 41
Oh, sorry!

84
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,708
You're too kind.

85
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02, 83
- Show some respect! - Tsk!

86
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04, 83
He sure runs away fast!

87
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,  0
Where'd you go?!

88
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,791
You're too kind.

89
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:27,666
Hmm... it's love...spinning its wheels...

90
00:12:28,  0 --> 00:12:30,541
No, it's not that.

91
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,375
Huh?

92
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:37,  0
I feel like if I take my eyes off of him, he'll just fade away...

93
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00, 41
Oh, hi.

94
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,541
Japan is at peace.

95
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,916
What a wonderful country!

96
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,125
This country will come to an end, Weismann!

97
00:14:03, 83 --> 00:14:05,666
Did you just say something?

98
00:14:15,  0 --> 00:14:17, 41
Yes, you are like a rose to me...

99
00:14:17, 83 --> 00:14:18,916
Say your lines like you're singing it!

100
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,  0
And vice versa!

101
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:21,958
Huh?

102
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,208
What about class?

103
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25, 83
We have the afternoon to prep for the school festival.

104
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,  0
Give us a hand.

105
00:14:27, 41 --> 00:14:28, 41
Sorry!

106
00:14:29, 83 --> 00:14:31,125
Can someone run an errand for the Student Council?

107
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,166
We need somebody who's free!

108
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,500
Let's see... Okay!

109
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,791
Shiro, I'm sending you the list.

110
00:14:46, 41 --> 00:14:46,875
Here.

111
00:14:48, 83 --> 00:14:48,916
Huh?

112
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,875
That's funny...?

113
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,750
You don't have your PDA?

114
00:14:58, 83 --> 00:15:00, 83
Okay, I'll write it down.

115
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,291
But you need to find your PDA first,

116
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,208
or you can't leave the school...

117
00:15:13, 41 --> 00:15:14, 41
No problem.

118
00:15:15,  0 --> 00:15:16,416
Can we stop somewhere on the way home?

119
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,333
Sure. Where are we going?

120
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,458
That new place from yesterday.

121
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,958
- Oh, okay then. - No problem.

122
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,166
Let's see...

123
00:15:26, 83 --> 00:15:28,166
Go to Kagitama Store over in Shizume Town

124
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,  0
to pick up the fireworks for the event.

125
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,166
Hand them the voucher and money.

126
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,166
Then head back to the Ashinaka High School Student Council...

127
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,333
and give them the receipt.

128
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,  0
Nice weather...

129
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:55,  0
Oh, right... Receipt, receipt...

130
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58, 41
Get the receipt and be back by six.

131
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,166
The place is...

132
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,208
Turn right by the huge TV...

133
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:16,333
The fire lights, showing the shadow of a foreign king...

134
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,500
Come again!

135
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,541
Thanks.

136
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,125
Huh?

137
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,458
Excuse me!

138
00:18:30,  0 --> 00:18:31,500
Get back here!

139
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,416
Sorry!

140
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,583
Out of the way!

141
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,208
Damn. Who was that guy?!

142
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,  0
Kuroh Yatogami, the "Black Dog."

143
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,166
We've got trouble on our hands.

144
00:20:56,  0 --> 00:21:00,458
Oh well. Guess we'll have to go with Plan B.

145
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,708
You brought us near the station.

146
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,916
Thank you. You've been a big help.

147
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17, 83
See you.

148
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:31,500
I am a vassal of the former Seventh King, Ichigen Miwa...

149
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36, 83
Kuroh Yatogami.

150
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,  0
"Vassal of the Seventh King, Ichigen Miwa"...?

151
00:21:41, 83 --> 00:21:42,500
Oh, is that your name?

152
00:21:43, 41 --> 00:21:44,750
How do you do? My name's Isana.

153
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46, 41
Yashiro Isana...

154
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,916
In compliance with my late master's dying wish,

155
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,125
I will slay the evil king!

156
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,541
King...what?!

157
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:09,666
Huh?

158
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:12,916
That's odd...

159
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:13,958
It won't turn off.

160
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,125
Huh? What is that?!

161
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,416
Hey, it's a nice night out.

162
00:22:27,  0 --> 00:22:29,625
I came out here to take pictures of the nighttime view,

163
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,875
but what are you doing out here?

164
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,208
I'm Tatara Totsuka. What's your name?

165
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:55,750
I am the Seventh King, the colorless king!

166
00:22:57, 83 --> 00:22:59,125
I'm waiting for someone here.

167
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,666
A nice night, you say?

168
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,458
Indeed it is.

169
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,166
Block 2 has been jacked!

170
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,166
- What about your side? - Block 4 has also been jacked!

171
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,166
Someone's hijacked the city's urban network.

172
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,916
Track down the source!

173
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,666
That's what we're doing...

174
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,541
It's so unlike you to pull off such a cheap move.

175
00:23:50,  0 --> 00:23:54,958
That's definitely you, right?

176
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:07,125
Uh... Yeah, looks like it...

177
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:12,500
Hello! I'm Yashiro Isana, the protagonist of the show

178
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:15,458
who's in the middle of getting himself killed.

179
00:24:16, 83 --> 00:24:18,166
By the way, what do you think of someone

180
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,125
who points a sword towards a person they've just met?

181
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,791
I'd say they're kind of rude and lack common sense, don't you agree?

182
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,125
Ow, ow, ow! Hey! Why are you stabbing me?!

183
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,333
Cut it out, I'm bleeding!

184
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,791
N-Next time on  K , #02 "Kitten."

185
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,291
Um... Anyone have a bandage?
