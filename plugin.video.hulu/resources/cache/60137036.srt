1
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,583
Die!

2
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,375
COOK

3
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,416
KEEP WARM

4
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,500
Fold the omelet quickly while the egg is still half-cooked.

5
00:00:34, 41 --> 00:00:35,625
The outside should be a bright, golden yellow.

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,583
Yashiro Isana.

7
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46, 41
Per your request, I have prepared lunch for you.

8
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,875
Do not, however, seal the box until the contents have cooled.

9
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,750
I've cooked the omelets to be sweet and fluffy,

10
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,416
but let me know if you prefer Dashi egg-rolls instead!

11
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:56,916
Ohh!

12
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,583
You! What are you doing?!

13
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:06,666
Die!

14
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10, 41
Wait!

15
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12, 83
That's not trash!

16
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,541
Die!

17
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,416
Huh? You can't be serious! Me too?!

18
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,166
Show some respect.

19
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:28,875
You hillbilly samurai!

20
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,833
Stop bullying...

21
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,333
- Shiro! - Know your place!

22
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,458
- This is no time for games! - Take that, and that,

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,125
- What are your plans? - and that!

24
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:40,750
- Plans? Go to school, of course. - You will pay for this!

25
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,416
- I have to turn in my assignment... - Shiro isn't trash!

26
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,875
- for classical literature class. - Have mercy!

27
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:45,916
- You... - Die!

28
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,875
- Have you forgotten what you said? - You're too kind!

29
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49, 41
I have failed...

30
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,291
Huh?!

31
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:54,  0
Do you have any intention of proving your innocence?!

32
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,166
Shiro, I'm glad you got to see your friend.

33
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,916
Yeah, I guess.

34
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,916
And who might you be?

35
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:02,916
I am a vassal of the former Seventh King, Ichigen Miwa,

36
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,166
Kuroh Yatogami.

37
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:09,333
What he's trying to say is... he's a transfer student...sort of.

38
00:04:10, 41 --> 00:04:12,291
Please do not mind me.

39
00:04:13, 83 --> 00:04:14,916
I see...

40
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,541
Thank you for helping me the other day.

41
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,916
I didn't know you were a transfer student.

42
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,333
I'm Kukuri Yukizome.

43
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,958
Kukuri Yukizome...

44
00:04:34,  0 --> 00:04:35,583
Just call me Kukuri.

45
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,541
So your name's Kuroh?

46
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,250
Kuro and Shiro— "black" and "white," like the game Othello.

47
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44, 41
WHAT IS MY ALIBI? If there's anything you need help with, feel free to ask.

48
00:04:44, 41 --> 00:04:45,166
Thank you.

49
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,208
Stop!

50
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03, 83
I admire your courage.

51
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,625
And, who might you be?

52
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,708
She's a transfer student...sort of.

53
00:05:23, 41 --> 00:05:27,625
Shiro brought a homemade lunch...

54
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,416
Made by my wife, with love.

55
00:05:31,  0 --> 00:05:34,916
That's not funny. Now stick out that tongue.

56
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,416
Any leftovers?

57
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39, 41
Want some?

58
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,291
Nothing but veggies...

59
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,791
Hey, where'd you get that?

60
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49, 83
It doesn't look like our school issued PDA.

61
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,666
It's my wife's.

62
00:05:52, 41 --> 00:05:53,625
Hope you've said goodbye to your tongue.

63
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,166
Did you find out anything?

64
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,791
No, can't tell anything from this blurry image.

65
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,125
What're you looking at?

66
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,125
Huh?

67
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,833
EARLIER IN THE DAY

68
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,791
Hey, Shiro!

69
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15, 41
I found the nastiest video yesterday.

70
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,208
You're really into that stuff, aren't you, Mishina?

71
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:22,791
I'm not that interested in erotic videos.

72
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24, 41
Yeah, you are!

73
00:06:24, 83 --> 00:06:26, 41
But this one was different!

74
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,291
Wait, you haven't told Miss Yukizome about

75
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,416
that porn pic I showed you the other day, have you?

76
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,500
No.

77
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,958
Good.

78
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,250
Anyway, here!

79
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,291
Check this one out.

80
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,125
He looks exactly like you, Shiro!

81
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,291
You're right.

82
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,125
If you committed a crime, turn yourself in, okay?

83
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:51,166
Mishina, that video of the guy who looks just like me has me worried.

84
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,750
Could you forward it to me?

85
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,208
It's an uncanny video I got from Mishina.

86
00:07:00, 83 --> 00:07:02,291
Huh? From Mishina...?!

87
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,375
Oh, come to think of it...

88
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,458
Quite a sight, isn't it?

89
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20, 83
Why don't you help us out instead of just slacking off?

90
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,291
I'm not slacking off, ma'am.

91
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,958
According to this video,

92
00:07:25,  0 --> 00:07:28,375
the crime occurred on December 7th at 23:45.

93
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,  0
The location is the rooftop of the Hirasaka Building

94
00:07:31,  0 --> 00:07:32,375
in the West Precinct.

95
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,375
So Mr. Totsuka's dead...

96
00:07:38, 83 --> 00:07:39, 83
Lieutenant Awashima!

97
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,125
Do we know his current location?

98
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,208
Yes. One moment.

99
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,750
Ashinaka High School?

100
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56, 41
So he's on the school island...

101
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,541
The video that was aired across the city,

102
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,583
was dated December 7th, 23:45 at night.

103
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,  0
Given the distance between my school and the crime scene,

104
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,458
there is no way I could have made it back in one hour.

105
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,208
Which means...

106
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16, 83
That's right.

107
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:22,625
If I can prove I was on campus on the 7th at around 23:45,

108
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,166
I would have an alibi...

109
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,708
But you live alone.

110
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,875
Claiming you were asleep by yourself isn't an alibi.

111
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,833
And just to be clear,

112
00:08:34,  0 --> 00:08:36,916
I'm not accepting anything this one says as an alibi!

113
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,  0
Stupid Kurosuke!

114
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,250
Shiro and I have been together from the moment we met!

115
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,416
My Shiro is a good Shiro.

116
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,791
Quiet!

117
00:08:49,  0 --> 00:08:50,791
I said I don't trust you.

118
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:56,125
If I find out you had a hand in his crimes, you'll pay dearly.

119
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,250
Prepare yourself for that.

120
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,208
Now, now... Things will be all right...

121
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,  0
That was the day we had permission to work on the school festival at night.

122
00:09:03,  0 --> 00:09:04,791
It's coming back to me now...

123
00:09:05,  0 --> 00:09:07, 83
All kinds of incidents happened that day.

124
00:09:08, 41 --> 00:09:08,875
Incidents?

125
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,  0
Yeah.

126
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:15,500
So I'm positive somebody can prove that I was there.

127
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:19,166
C'mon! How long does it take you to change?!

128
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22, 41
Hey, you look good!

129
00:09:22, 83 --> 00:09:23,375
Seriously Shiro,

130
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,  0
you make a great Ebisu, even though you're not fat.

131
00:09:26,  0 --> 00:09:27,750
That's pretty rare, you know.

132
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,416
And you, miss, look beautiful.

133
00:09:32, 83 --> 00:09:34,250
I am beautiful!

134
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,375
Kukuri, do you have a second?

135
00:09:37, 41 --> 00:09:39,333
It's about December 7th...

136
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,583
Here it comes...

137
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59, 41
Here.

138
00:10:00, 41 --> 00:10:01,583
He's a student at the school on the island?

139
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,875
Of all the difficult places...

140
00:10:07,  0 --> 00:10:08,208
What'll we do?

141
00:10:09, 83 --> 00:10:10,125
How the fuck should I know?!

142
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,875
Yata?

143
00:10:13,  0 --> 00:10:14, 83
That idiot...

144
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,166
Miss Kukuri Yukizome!

145
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,125
The minute I saw you, it was love at first sight!

146
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,833
Please be my girl!

147
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,500
I'm...

148
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,  0
I'm sorry!

149
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,500
My heart is broken!

150
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02, 83
And that's what happened.

151
00:11:03, 41 --> 00:11:06, 41
Why're you bringing that up again?

152
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,583
The feeling of love

153
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,916
A shower of fireworks It bursts then fizzles

154
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,583
Creepy!

155
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,541
But boy, that was quite a show.

156
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21, 83
It happened just before midnight, right?

157
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,666
Around 23:45 to be exact?

158
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,208
Yeah, it was... But why is that so important?

159
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,708
I was there watching it, remember?

160
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,458
I don't know.

161
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,500
Maybe you were, but I'm not really sure.

162
00:11:38, 83 --> 00:11:39,666
Hey, come on...

163
00:11:40, 83 --> 00:11:42,208
That was the last thing on my mind!

164
00:11:44, 41 --> 00:11:47,333
Is that guy planning to blow up all the school festival fireworks?!

165
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,208
Drag him out of there, quick!

166
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,958
Here comes the student council!

167
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,375
Remove the door. We're going in!

168
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,  0
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM During that whole incident,

169
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,875
I was also there.

170
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06, 83
Do you recall?

171
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,333
Nope.

172
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,583
I was too busy dragging down that idiot from up there.

173
00:12:12, 83 --> 00:12:15,  0
Yes, things were going really out of control.

174
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,250
If you hadn't acted so swiftly,

175
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,125
who knows what might've happened?

176
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,500
Would you like to check the news article from that day?

177
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,916
LOVELORN FIREWORKS LIGHT UP THE NIGHT! - BY THE DAILY ASHINKA

178
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,916
LOVELORN FIREWORKS LIGHT UP THE NIGHT! - BY THE DAILY ASHINKA I'm not in the photo.

179
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,958
If you want a photo of yourself during the commotion,

180
00:12:32,  0 --> 00:12:33,875
why not ask someone at the school newspaper?

181
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,625
They were taking lots of photos that day.

182
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39, 83
That's right...

183
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,916
After that, the class president dealt

184
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,208
with one issue after another effectively.

185
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48, 41
There should be photos of all of that.

186
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,208
By the way...

187
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,  0
I realize we're getting ready for the school festival,

188
00:12:53, 41 --> 00:12:57,208
but you can't go around school dressed so outrageously.

189
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,166
Especially you. Sword props like that are prohibited.

190
00:13:02, 83 --> 00:13:03,583
This is not a prop!

191
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,208
- Stop laughing! - Thank you for your time.

192
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,166
Easy there!

193
00:13:20, 83 --> 00:13:21,916
Awesome.

194
00:13:24, 83 --> 00:13:25,250
You idiot!

195
00:13:31, 41 --> 00:13:32,125
Oh no!

196
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34, 41
Somebody bring a fire extinguisher!

197
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,833
Stop that horse!

198
00:13:37, 41 --> 00:13:38,958
This has impact!

199
00:13:39,  0 --> 00:13:41,  0
You! Go around that way!

200
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,208
Don't miss any sweet shots!

201
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,166
Right.

202
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55, 83
I'm not in here...

203
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,750
I'm positive I was around here someplace.

204
00:14:00, 41 --> 00:14:01,416
Are you sure?

205
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,666
- We have a ton of photos from that day, - Show some respect.

206
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,333
- so if you were there, you should... - I'm in heaven...

207
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,125
- be able to find yourself. - Show some respect.

208
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,166
But I'm not in here...

209
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,  0
So you don't have an alibi, after all!

210
00:14:13, 41 --> 00:14:14,458
What's this about an alibi?

211
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,583
Was there an incident?

212
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:16,916
I smell a scoop.

213
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,  0
No, it's nothing like that.

214
00:14:19,  0 --> 00:14:20,750
- You're too kind... - You're too kind...

215
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,  0
- You're too kind... - You're too kind!

216
00:14:22,  0 --> 00:14:24,  0
- This is a problem. - You hillbilly samurai!

217
00:14:24, 41 --> 00:14:27, 41
- Easy there. - I was sure there'd be a photo.

218
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,583
You guys!

219
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,416
We're all super busy! Help us out!

220
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,  0
Thank you.

221
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,583
Where does this go?

222
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,500
- Could you take that... - Die! - Have mercy!

223
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,125
- to the teachers' office? - Die! - Have mercy!

224
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:49,833
End of the line!

225
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53, 41
I have to bring this to the student council room.

226
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,375
Understood.

227
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,541
Oh, that's right.

228
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,208
The teachers' office.

229
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,375
Thank you. Leave it there, please.

230
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,958
Sir, I have a small favor.

231
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,500
You want to see a log of the students

232
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,708
who passed through the main gate?

233
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,  0
Yes...

234
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,  0
All right. But what do you need it for?

235
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,541
It's nothing that important...

236
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,166
Just that I might be killed.

237
00:15:21, 83 --> 00:15:22,333
Oh, I see.

238
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,416
What day are you looking for?

239
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,833
December 7th.

240
00:15:26, 83 --> 00:15:28,375
Let's have a look... The seventh...

241
00:15:30,  0 --> 00:15:35,458
Arisawa...Ariyoshi...Iida... Ikuno...and Inoue.

242
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,  0
You see? There's no Yahiro Isana.

243
00:15:38,  0 --> 00:15:41,208
Shiro Shiro! I am hungry.

244
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,750
- This clears me of suspicion, right? - I am... I am...

245
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:45,958
I am...

246
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,208
Hungry!

247
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,125
Sorry...

248
00:15:52, 41 --> 00:15:53,875
There's nothing to worry about anymore,

249
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,125
so let's enjoy a snack.

250
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,250
Yahoo! A snack! A snack!

251
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,791
Speaking of snacks,

252
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03, 83
Kukuri said she had some delicious rice crackers!

253
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,500
And her friend said

254
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,583
she'll buy me some tasty Daifuku mochi!

255
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,458
Daifuku, Daifuku!

256
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,250
Oh, now I'm thirsty...

257
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,791
Shiro, can you buy me a drink?

258
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,291
Like I told you...

259
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,916
Everyone who enters or leaves this island

260
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,416
is scanned and checked at the automatic gate.

261
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22, 83
If I'm not on this list,

262
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,333
it means I was on this island the whole time,

263
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,708
and couldn't have been at the scene of the crime.

264
00:16:27, 83 --> 00:16:28,125
Get it?

265
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,208
I want juice.

266
00:16:33, 41 --> 00:16:34,958
Oops, not enough small change.

267
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,583
Forgot your PDA again?

268
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43, 41
It's a rule— you have to keep it on you.

269
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,916
Isn't it inconvenient without it?

270
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:50,541
Kukuri, are you saying he does not carry a PDA with him?

271
00:16:51, 41 --> 00:16:53,708
He always forgets, no matter how many times I tell him.

272
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,791
Without his PDA, he could not get past the gate, correct?

273
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,541
This guy just sneaks out.

274
00:17:04, 83 --> 00:17:08,125
Kukuri, something is about to happen that will make you nauseous.

275
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,166
Leave us.

276
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,  0
W-Wait a minute!

277
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,125
I'll get serious! I'll find real proof!

278
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,291
I've heard enough.

279
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,166
It's become quite clear that you are insincere.

280
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,916
Step aside.

281
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,250
Or are you working for him, after all?

282
00:17:26, 83 --> 00:17:28,500
Is it your wish to be slain with your master?

283
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,291
I am Neko!

284
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,  0
I am Shiro's cat!

285
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,833
I'm not letting you take him, Kurosuke!

286
00:17:35, 41 --> 00:17:36,625
Shiro is a warm person and

287
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,458
I'm going to have delicious meals and snacks with him!

288
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,833
Easy, Neko...

289
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45, 41
You're making things more complicated.

290
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,666
Shiro... Shiro...

291
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,333
I'm...sorry, Kuro.

292
00:18:22,  0 --> 00:18:24,250
I'll get more serious from now on.

293
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,458
A lot more happened that day!

294
00:18:27, 83 --> 00:18:30,750
There was the sprinkler that broke, the toilet that overflowed,

295
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,208
and the school gym storeroom ceiling that caved in, just to name a few!

296
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,708
I had to be there, somewhere!

297
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,  0
Hold on.

298
00:18:38, 41 --> 00:18:42,166
If it's the school gym storeroom, then I did see you, Shiro.

299
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:49, 41
That day, after I ran away from the incident Mishima caused,

300
00:18:49, 83 --> 00:18:52, 83
Shiro and I found this hole together.

301
00:18:53,  0 --> 00:18:55, 41
Yeah, that's right.

302
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:59,  0
Do you remember around what time that was?

303
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03, 41
That would be 12:30.

304
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,750
That's within an hour of the crime!

305
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13, 41
It would have been impossible

306
00:19:13, 83 --> 00:19:15,916
to return here from the crime scene by then.

307
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,500
That means...I have an alibi!

308
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,500
What? What are you talking about?

309
00:19:22, 83 --> 00:19:26,  0
I owe you my life... That's what.

310
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,625
Stop dawdling!

311
00:19:34, 41 --> 00:19:36,416
Remember, we don't have much time until the school festival!

312
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,250
Yes, sorry!

313
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,916
It's incredible.

314
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,208
- Ever since Kuro got serious... - Less talking, more action!

315
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43, 41
about helping us, we're getting so much done.

316
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,500
Really! The transfer student's working so hard

317
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,375
while that guy disappears again.

318
00:19:50, 41 --> 00:19:52, 41
A bigger concern is...

319
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,625
Are these people really transfers?

320
00:20:02, 41 --> 00:20:04,375
Boy, I'm beat!

321
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:08, 83
Having someone try to kill you every day is exhausting.

322
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,166
Oops, I left my uniform in the classroom.

323
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,458
Well, that's okay...

324
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,250
Hey, it's a nice night out.

325
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,416
I came out here to take pictures of the night view,

326
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,791
but what are you doing out here?

327
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,166
I'm Tatara Tosuka. What's your name?

328
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,916
I am the Seventh King, the Colorless King!

329
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,166
I'm waiting for someone here.

330
00:21:08, 41 --> 00:21:09,666
A nice night, you say?

331
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,166
Indeed, it is.

332
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23, 83
Shiro!

333
00:21:25,  0 --> 00:21:26,791
W-What's the matter?

334
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,750
Oh yeah, your snack.

335
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,166
Kukuri gave me super-spicy rice crackers,

336
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,875
and asked me to call you.

337
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:39,  0
After I do that, she promised me ultra-spicy rice crackers!

338
00:21:40, 83 --> 00:21:41,541
Okay, I'll be right there.

339
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,375
Shiro?

340
00:21:45, 83 --> 00:21:47,125
Do you have a tummy ache?

341
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,500
It's nothing.

342
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,250
No, it can't be...

343
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,666
You're too kind.

344
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,666
So this is where that piece of shit is...

345
00:22:22, 41 --> 00:22:26,125
Just you wait, I'll tear you apart...

346
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,333
Huh?

347
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,625
Huh?

348
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:12,166
I had an early shift, and now, I'm doing overtime?

349
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,958
Can't we just let HOMRA take care of Tatara Totsuka's murderer?

350
00:24:18, 83 --> 00:24:20, 41
Why do we have to go through all the trouble?

351
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,250
Yeah, yeah, the next preview, right?

352
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,958
I'm doing it now.

353
00:24:24, 41 --> 00:24:26,708
Next time... Oh?

354
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29, 41
So he's coming, huh?

355
00:24:29, 41 --> 00:24:30,250
Finally...

356
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,791
Next time, on K, #05 "Knife."

357
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:37,125
I should be the object of your hate, not him!
