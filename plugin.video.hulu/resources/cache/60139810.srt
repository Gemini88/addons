1
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:09,916
I'm sure you are all busy preparing for the upcoming school festival.

2
00:00:10, 83 --> 00:00:13,833
But please refrain from getting carried away with the festivities,

3
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:18, 83
and remember to uphold the tradition and honor of this school.

4
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,750
Your families will be joining us on festival day.

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,291
Show them the results of all the hard work

6
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,833
- Are these all of the costumes? -  you put into this past few weeks...

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,375
Okay, everyone check your own costumes.

8
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:32,916
Let me know if you're having any trouble with the size.

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35, 41
How are the decorations coming along?

10
00:00:36,  0 --> 00:00:37,416
We're not quite done...

11
00:00:38, 41 --> 00:00:39,750
Okay, I'll help you.

12
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42, 41
Who else is free right now?

13
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:46,791
Rice crackers...

14
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,166
- What is it, Kuro? - Rice crackers...

15
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,333
- Your sleeve is torn right near the elbow. - Rice crackers...

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53, 41
Oh, you're right.

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,708
- I must've caught it on something. - Rice crackers!

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,208
- When can I have my rice crackers?! - Let me...

19
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,250
fix that for you.

20
00:00:59,  0 --> 00:01:00,125
Hold still.

21
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,291
Rice crackers...

22
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,458
My rice crackers...

23
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:07,833
Rice crackers!

24
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:08,875
We'll be done in a minute.

25
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31, 83
That would be 12:30.

26
00:01:32, 83 --> 00:01:34,750
That's within an hour of the crime!

27
00:01:35, 41 --> 00:01:38, 41
It would have been impossible to return here

28
00:01:38, 83 --> 00:01:39,791
from the crime scene by then.

29
00:01:56, 41 --> 00:01:57,416
Yashiro Isana!

30
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,541
That's enough dawdling!

31
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,250
Shiro got a scolding!

32
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,208
Kuro! Please keep your eyes on what you're doing!

33
00:02:09, 83 --> 00:02:10, 83
Sorry...

34
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,875
What was I supposed to be doing, now?

35
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,  0
Let's all have some rice crackers!

36
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,250
I said to get working!

37
00:02:18, 41 --> 00:02:19,666
Please, Kuro!

38
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:21,500
I know...

39
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,708
Shiro, if you don't have anything to do,

40
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25, 41
can I ask a favor?

41
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:02,958
Yes.

42
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,791
Yes, that's correct.

43
00:04:07, 83 --> 00:04:08,208
At Ashinaka High School.

44
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,166
The Yuishiki System has found someone there

45
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,208
who is a 91 percent match.

46
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,875
Yes, I'm positive.

47
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,500
I'd like to go there personally to be sure.

48
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,541
I understand. Goodbye.

49
00:04:28,  0 --> 00:04:29,125
We have authorization.

50
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31, 83
We will now head to the school on the island

51
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,875
to confirm the suspect's presence.

52
00:04:33,  0 --> 00:04:33,791
- Yes, ma'am! - Yes, ma'am!

53
00:04:34, 83 --> 00:04:35,541
Have a safe trip...

54
00:04:36, 83 --> 00:04:38,208
You're coming too, Fushimi.

55
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,875
Are you serious?

56
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,166
What will you do when you find him?

57
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,291
Take him into custody, of course.

58
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,250
And if he resists?

59
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,708
That's a stupid question.

60
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,375
So we use this to get in?

61
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10, 41
What a pain in the ass.

62
00:05:11, 83 --> 00:05:11,750
Let's go.

63
00:05:12,  0 --> 00:05:12,541
Right!

64
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,375
We're going for a walk!

65
00:05:28, 83 --> 00:05:31,  0
Why do you keep using this exit?

66
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,666
I told you. I lost my PDA.

67
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,333
Oh, wait. Maybe I should just install my passcode into yours.

68
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,  0
Request for a new one already!

69
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,875
Shiro! Hurry, hurry!

70
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48, 41
We have to order more fireworks

71
00:05:48, 83 --> 00:05:51, 41
because you blew up all that we had.

72
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,458
I had no choice. You were trying to kill me.

73
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,  0
Don't you realize how busy we are?

74
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,208
Sounds like you're starting to fit right in...

75
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,583
Die!

76
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:22,916
Die!

77
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:23,916
Die!

78
00:06:24, 41 --> 00:06:24,625
Die!

79
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:26,625
Die!

80
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,458
Die!

81
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,250
Show some respect...

82
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,250
All right. We're going in.

83
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,  0
Okay.

84
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,  0
We apologize for this rather sudden request,

85
00:07:11,  0 --> 00:07:13,166
but we need your cooperation.

86
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,875
I want to reiterate.

87
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,500
We will not cause your school any trouble.

88
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,583
Yes, but...

89
00:07:24,  0 --> 00:07:25,958
Given the current times,

90
00:07:26,  0 --> 00:07:29,  0
releasing personal student information is, how should I put it...?

91
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,791
I need you to understand that if need be,

92
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,541
we are not above using legal means.

93
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38, 41
We can't have that!

94
00:07:38, 41 --> 00:07:43,666
No. We would like to handle things as amicably as possible, as well.

95
00:07:44, 41 --> 00:07:48,708
Therefore, we'd prefer that you cooperated willingly.

96
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,166
I...understand.

97
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,125
But to find a student whose name and class you don't even know

98
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58, 83
from among the entire student body is...

99
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,333
As a practical matter,

100
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,708
there's little we can realistically do right away...

101
00:08:04,  0 --> 00:08:05,  0
Let me make myself clear...

102
00:08:06, 83 --> 00:08:09, 41
This investigation has already been authorized.

103
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,875
If your school lacks the means to conduct an investigation,

104
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,208
we will do it for you.

105
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,708
You'd do it yourselves?

106
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,250
That's going too far!

107
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,125
I think you're misunderstanding. We are not trying...

108
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,541
to "persuade" you.

109
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,  0
We are here to explain the situation

110
00:08:26, 41 --> 00:08:27,833
and to "order" you to act accordingly.

111
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29, 41
But that's...

112
00:08:29, 83 --> 00:08:34,791
As I said earlier, it is not our wish to turn this into a pubic issue.

113
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,125
However, I have no reservations about using the law...

114
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,833
...to take appropriate action.

115
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,750
Hey, know this guy?

116
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,625
Come back here!

117
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49, 41
Know where we can find this guy?

118
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,958
You know this guy, don't you?!

119
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,  0
Yata, let's ask them next.

120
00:09:00, 83 --> 00:09:01,  0
We're moving on.

121
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,875
Wait up, Yata!

122
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,583
You're too damn slow!

123
00:09:12, 41 --> 00:09:13,  0
Geez!

124
00:09:13, 41 --> 00:09:15,416
It's all that stuff you eat while we're on the job...

125
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,166
That's why you're so fat!

126
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,666
What about you, Yata? Have you been eating?

127
00:09:21, 83 --> 00:09:25,  0
I haven't seen you take any breaks at all ever since that day.

128
00:09:27, 83 --> 00:09:28,125
I'm fine.

129
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,958
STUDENT COUNCIL

130
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32, 83
Huh?

131
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:46,833
NOT A MATCH

132
00:10:49, 41 --> 00:10:49,875
NOT A MATCH

133
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:52,875
NOT A MATCH

134
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,166
Take a good look, you!

135
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,166
You shifted your eyes, didn't you?!

136
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,833
N-No! I didn't!

137
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,458
You know this guy, don't you?!

138
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,166
I don't! I have no idea!

139
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,750
Where is he, damn it?!

140
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,125
You can't run away!

141
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,  0
Another dead end. Shit!

142
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:28,916
Yata, this isn't gonna work. This place is huge.

143
00:11:29, 83 --> 00:11:30, 83
Shut up!

144
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:34,875
I don't want to waste another second,

145
00:11:35,  0 --> 00:11:37, 83
to avenge Mr. Totsuka's death!

146
00:11:47, 83 --> 00:11:48,541
Hey... You two!

147
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50, 41
Come here a second.

148
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,916
We want to ask you something!

149
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,750
Uh, we don't...

150
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,125
Huh?

151
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,458
What's the matter?

152
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,625
I just said we want to ask some questions.

153
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,250
Ouch!

154
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:02,375
Idiot!

155
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:06,416
Don't scare girls like that, or I'll kill you.

156
00:12:07, 41 --> 00:12:09, 83
Hey, sorry about!

157
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,541
Cut me some slack, Yata!

158
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,416
Shut up!

159
00:12:18,  0 --> 00:12:20,666
I keep telling you! Don't ever threaten the ladies!

160
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,166
But I didn't...

161
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:28, 41
All this time, Yata, you've only been talking to guys.

162
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,541
We need to ask girls, too...

163
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33, 83
To find a guy, you ask guys!

164
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34, 83
Huh?

165
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:38,166
Still can't get yourself laid, huh?

166
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,458
You bastard...

167
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,250
Saruhiko!

168
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,916
Fancy meeting you here. How'd you find this place?

169
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,541
Oh, you had Anna's help.

170
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,708
But Mr. Kusanagi wouldn't send you here to ask questions.

171
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,  0
My guess is you acted on your own again, huh, Misaki?

172
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,416
You never change.

173
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,458
Shut the fuck up!

174
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05, 41
Don't go calling me by my first name!

175
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,916
Or talk about my people like you know them.

176
00:13:08, 83 --> 00:13:10,416
You traitor!

177
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14, 41
Can you blame me?

178
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,833
In the end, I wasn't like you and the others.

179
00:13:18, 41 --> 00:13:19,916
Leaving was inevitable.

180
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,  0
Damn right about that!

181
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,291
You're not like us!

182
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,708
Yata, you can't make a scene here...

183
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,416
So, Misaki, how'd you manage to sneak in here?

184
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,125
Huh? None of your business.

185
00:13:38, 41 --> 00:13:40,  0
Security's tight here.

186
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,458
Where's your pass? Show it to me, Misaki.

187
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,500
It's none of your business!

188
00:13:47,  0 --> 00:13:51,166
And don't call me by my first name. Gives me the creeps.

189
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:57,750
Oh yeah, you hate being called by that name...

190
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,708
Mi...sa...ki...

191
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,125
You asked for it...

192
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,541
Yata!

193
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10, 83
Don't do this!

194
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,125
Remember what Mr. Kusanagi said!

195
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,791
Don't let Mr. Mikoto's capture be in vain!

196
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,916
What good would fighting that Monkey here do?!

197
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,375
Mr. Mikoto...eh?

198
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31, 83
That man seems to have lost his edge.

199
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,791
After all, he went to jail willingly.

200
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,  0
Guess it means he's grown up.

201
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:43,  0
You could learn from him, Mi...sa...ki.

202
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,125
Yata!

203
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,708
Monkey!

204
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,  0
Die, you bastard!

205
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:08, 41
Fushimi, ready for emergency battle.

206
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,250
Not as sharp as you used to be, Monkey.

207
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,791
No...

208
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,750
I've become stronger than before...

209
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,416
Much stronger.

210
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,750
Bullshit!

211
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:42,916
What's the matter, Monkey?!

212
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,458
Yata!

213
00:17:00, 41 --> 00:17:01,500
I just told you...

214
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:08,833
I've acquired even more power since leaving Mikoto Suoh's side.

215
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,166
This is the proof.

216
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15, 83
T-Two colors?!

217
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,125
Damn it!

218
00:17:19, 83 --> 00:17:21,250
Stay out of this, punk.

219
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24, 41
This is no place for a loser like you!

220
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,125
Monkey's...

221
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,666
right.

222
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,625
Keep out of this.

223
00:17:35, 83 --> 00:17:36,708
Yata...

224
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,666
Monkey, don't get cocky because of those half-assed powers.

225
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,125
Think you own the country now?

226
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54, 83
I'm not interested in anything as crass as the country.

227
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,750
What I'm interested in is...

228
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,666
blood and flesh...

229
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,333
That's enough!

230
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,166
That's enough, you two!

231
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:40,500
Put away your sword!

232
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:42,791
Fushimi!

233
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45, 83
What do you think you're doing out here in broad daylight?

234
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47, 83
Did you forget where we are right now?!

235
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,416
You are Misaki Yata of the militant faction

236
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,208
under the Red King, are you not?

237
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,958
You wield a skateboard and

238
00:19:00,  0 --> 00:19:02,541
serve as the vanguard of Team HOMRA

239
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,291
and go by the name of...Yatagarasu.

240
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,625
I know about you, too.

241
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,166
You're the Blue King's right-hand woman, Seri Awashima.

242
00:19:13,  0 --> 00:19:15, 83
People call you... The Heartless Woman.

243
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:23,166
The only person who calls me that is the owner of a certain bar.

244
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,  0
Huh?

245
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:29,500
Be that as it may, I cannot condone your presence here.

246
00:19:30,  0 --> 00:19:31, 83
But unfortunately,

247
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,750
there's too much to lose if I make an issue of it here.

248
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,666
How about if the two of you postpone your match?

249
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,958
He started it.

250
00:19:42,  0 --> 00:19:45, 41
Is that so? Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

251
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:50,666
You  will  postpone your match. Comply.

252
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,250
Was that better?

253
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,125
I don't have a reason to obey you, Blues.

254
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,750
Yata!

255
00:20:02, 83 --> 00:20:03,583
Your king...

256
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,291
All he does is complain about how bad the food is,

257
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,875
finishes up, and then goes to sleep like a baby.

258
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,166
He's quite a piece of work.

259
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,708
Mr. Mikoto...

260
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21, 41
Let's go.

261
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,833
Is it okay to let them go?

262
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,208
We have no choice.

263
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,666
Fushimi.

264
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,291
Do you have something to tell me?

265
00:20:58, 83 --> 00:20:59,666
I'm very sorry.

266
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,541
So, how'd it go?

267
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,333
How'd what go?

268
00:21:05, 83 --> 00:21:06, 83
Don't play dumb.

269
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,541
You were accessing the school's data, weren't you?

270
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,333
That should do it for now.

271
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,916
Let's go back, Yata.

272
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,708
Yata!

273
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,  0
I heard you.

274
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,750
After one more person!

275
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43, 41
I want to ask just one more person!

276
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,916
Wait...Yata!

277
00:21:47,  0 --> 00:21:50,416
Ugh, what was it? I swear I heard it a minute ago.

278
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,166
Hey, you there!

279
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,250
Yes?

280
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,916
I-I'm looking for someone...

281
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,916
This guy...have you seen him?

282
00:22:05, 41 --> 00:22:09,  0
Well? Is that boy a student here?

283
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15, 41
Well?

284
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,333
No.

285
00:22:21,  0 --> 00:22:22,  0
I'm sorry.

286
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,458
NO MATCHES FOUND

287
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,875
The suspect is not a student at this school.

288
00:22:34, 83 --> 00:22:35,666
I don't know him.

289
00:24:09, 41 --> 00:24:11,375
Fuck! Another dead end!

290
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,916
Worst part, I had to run into that Monkey!

291
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:19, 41
I can't afford to lose any more time in finding the bastard!

292
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:24, 41
Those stupid, but fun times I spent with Mr. Mikoto,

293
00:24:24, 83 --> 00:24:26,458
the guys, and that person...

294
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,791
That bastard destroyed it all!

295
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:32,791
Next time on K, #06 "Karma."

296
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36, 41
Those days will never come back...
