1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,291
Creepy.

2
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,625
Kuroh Yatogami and confederate!

3
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49, 41
What?

4
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,  0
This is SCEPTER 4. In accordance with Article 2

5
00:02:53,  0 --> 00:02:55,  0
of the Supernatural Regulation Exemption Act,

6
00:02:55,  0 --> 00:02:57, 83
we are taking you into custody!

7
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,666
Huh? Uh...

8
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,666
I'm not sure what's going on, but uh... Sorry.

9
00:03:06,  0 --> 00:03:06,916
We refuse!

10
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,  0
Permission to use our sabers...

11
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12, 83
Granted.

12
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,125
Men! Draw your swords!

13
00:03:16, 41 --> 00:03:17,375
- Akiyama, ready! - Benzai, ready!

14
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,750
- Kamo, ready! - Domyoji, ready!

15
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20, 83
- Enomoto, ready! - Fuse, ready!

16
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,625
- Goto, ready! - Hidaka, ready!

17
00:03:22, 41 --> 00:03:23,125
Awashima...

18
00:03:25, 83 --> 00:03:26,208
ready!

19
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,458
Huh?

20
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,291
What happened?

21
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,541
Oh, Neko!

22
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,916
What?! Where did all these civilians come from?

23
00:04:02, 41 --> 00:04:04,  0
Wait... Something's not right!

24
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,541
Headquarters!

25
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,166
Headquarters, do you read?

26
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,541
Sensory interference.

27
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19, 83
Seal off the perimeter. Stay sharp!

28
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38, 41
I will handle this one!

29
00:04:38, 83 --> 00:04:39,833
- Man your posts! - Yes, sir!

30
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,416
Stand back.

31
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,125
Go ahead. Draw your sword.

32
00:04:50, 83 --> 00:04:53,291
This sword is not for killing the likes of you.

33
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,166
Then, be slain by "the likes of me"!

34
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,166
We seem to be lacking the winning edge.

35
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,666
Maybe it's time you went to work.

36
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,708
Let's see you dodge this!

37
00:05:34, 83 --> 00:05:35,208
What is that?

38
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,416
The Sword of...Damocles!

39
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,666
The Blue King... Reisi Munakata.

40
00:06:07, 41 --> 00:06:08, 83
Well done...

41
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,375
Thanks to your efforts, I have a grasp of the situation.

42
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,250
Sir!

43
00:06:14, 83 --> 00:06:16,291
Guess I'd better get to work.

44
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20, 41
It seems Mr. Fushimi is growing impatient.

45
00:06:48, 41 --> 00:06:50,166
As I suspected, a third party,

46
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54, 41
an unknown Strain, was behind this.

47
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:59,  0
By projecting her powers within a perimeter with herself at the center,

48
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,708
she can interfere and manipulate

49
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,125
the human senses and perceptions of those around her.

50
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,791
It is an all too dangerous power.

51
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,875
Uh... You think we should surrender?

52
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,458
I'll hold off that man.

53
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,  0
The two of you fend for yourselves.

54
00:07:33,  0 --> 00:07:34,  0
Huh?

55
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42, 83
Go!

56
00:07:42, 83 --> 00:07:43,333
But, Kuro...!

57
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,  0
Seal the corridor!

58
00:07:59, 83 --> 00:08:00,  0
Roger.

59
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,375
I'll send in the men on the outside.

60
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,416
I see... So you chose to sacrifice yourself.

61
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,625
The celebrated sword Kotowari...

62
00:08:13,  0 --> 00:08:15,125
It used to belong to the late Seventh King,

63
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18, 41
Ichigen Miwa, the Colorless King.

64
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,  0
I suppose you could try and kill me with that.

65
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,583
Didn't you hear me?

66
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,  0
I told you to draw your sword.

67
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,708
That's more like it...

68
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:43,875
What's this?

69
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,458
Such a disobedient child.

70
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,125
If you insist on being so stubborn, you leave me no choice.

71
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:18,208
Mr. Yatogami, what do you say we end this game?

72
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,208
I refuse...

73
00:09:36, 83 --> 00:09:37,458
Now then...

74
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,958
Let's get to the subject at hand.

75
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,  0
This way!

76
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,125
Hurry, Shiro!

77
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:08,875
You showed magnificent self-sacrifice against me.

78
00:10:10, 83 --> 00:10:11,583
That young man...

79
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,375
Is he the master you serve now?

80
00:10:15, 83 --> 00:10:20,625
The Colorless King. The Seventh, and weakest king.

81
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,583
He is not a powerful presence alone,

82
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,791
but he is the wild card

83
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,541
who could tip the balance of power between the kings.

84
00:10:32, 41 --> 00:10:33, 41
In other words,

85
00:10:33, 83 --> 00:10:36,625
he is the one person I need to be most wary of.

86
00:10:37, 41 --> 00:10:39,666
That young man is the new Colorless King

87
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,208
who will replace Ichigen Miwa...

88
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,916
Am I correct?

89
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,208
Answer me.

90
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,250
Master Ichigen told me to vet that man.

91
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55, 41
Oh? And what is your verdict?

92
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,250
I will not let anyone lay a hand on him until I make that decision.

93
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,875
I see...

94
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
That might have been his plan from the start.

95
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,208
Remaining neither good nor evil...

96
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,916
As long as he maintains that ambiguous position,

97
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:20,375
he can keep the "Black Dog," Kuroh Yatogami, as his bodyguard.

98
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,  0
He could not ask for a more powerful pawn.

99
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,958
Using that young female Strain,

100
00:11:26,  0 --> 00:11:29,666
deceiving you and the people around him would be a simple matter.

101
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:36,291
All of us might be puppets in that young man's scheme.

102
00:11:37,  0 --> 00:11:38,625
Wouldn't you agree?

103
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,791
You have a point...

104
00:11:41, 83 --> 00:11:43,541
He's constantly laughing like a fool

105
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,125
and everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie.

106
00:11:47,  0 --> 00:11:48,708
That's the sort of fellow he is.

107
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:53,708
Is that man worth risking your life for?

108
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,458
Oh? Did you forget something?

109
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,416
You fool! Why'd you come backÃ¢?!

110
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:23,625
Well, I guess I can't just leave my friends behind, can I?

111
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,125
I see.

112
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,166
So you came back to share your fate together.

113
00:12:29, 83 --> 00:12:31,166
That is a noble gesture.

114
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,666
But meaningless.

115
00:12:34, 83 --> 00:12:38,208
No... You see, it's not meaningless.

116
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,250
Oh?

117
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,916
You see... Kuroh, I'm sorry!

118
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,375
I've been lying to you all this time!

119
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,416
The truth is...

120
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,166
this is who I am.

121
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,125
Kuroh...

122
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,  0
Can you hear me, Kuroh?

123
00:13:42, 83 --> 00:13:43,125
Captain!

124
00:13:57, 83 --> 00:13:58,750
The outer perimeter's been breached!

125
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,458
What?!

126
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03, 83
I should have known better...

127
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,375
I fell for it hook, line and sinker.

128
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,958
Fushimi, call in the local police.

129
00:14:14,  0 --> 00:14:14,875
Roger!

130
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,958
Hey! Are you okay?!

131
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,416
It's not serious...

132
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,625
I'll be fine in two minutes....

133
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,875
Say, Neko...

134
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51, 41
You were amazing back there.

135
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,250
Those people in blue were amazing too.

136
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57, 83
But the way you cleared the sky,

137
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:01,166
and then changed the scenery with lots of people showing up was just amazing...

138
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,541
And on top of that, you saved us.

139
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,416
I-I don't know what you're talking about...

140
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:13,833
What the Blue leader said about interfering with people's perceptions...

141
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,291
Was that what he was talking about?

142
00:15:17,  0 --> 00:15:19,666
Her powers aren't limited to visual and auditory hallucinations.

143
00:15:21,  0 --> 00:15:23,125
Her power to manipulate perception

144
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,125
can even play with a person's memory.

145
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,458
Huh? What do you mean?

146
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:33,458
This girl can create false memories in people,

147
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36, 83
and make people who've met for the first time

148
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,166
believe they're old friends.

149
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:41,791
You...

150
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,  0
-  Mishina...  -  C'mon!

151
00:15:44,  0 --> 00:15:45,666
-  Here you go.  -  Thanks!

152
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,375
Here.

153
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,125
Hey, there's some over here too!

154
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,291
-  Thanks.  -  Here!

155
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,458
Oh...

156
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,708
I see now...

157
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,333
It's all finally coming together.

158
00:16:04, 83 --> 00:16:05,375
Okay, then.

159
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,  0
Neko...

160
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,375
Fix this amnesia thing right now.

161
00:16:15,  0 --> 00:16:17,  0
That way, we'll know for sure

162
00:16:17, 41 --> 00:16:20,166
if I'm that evil king you're chasing after.

163
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,250
If I find out that you are the evil king,

164
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,333
it means I will slay you on the spot.

165
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,125
Yeah, I suppose it does.

166
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,  0
Your life is at stake.

167
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,791
Calm down and think it over.

168
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,416
I am calm!

169
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,166
I mean it.

170
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,875
At any rate, I'm okay with discussing this

171
00:16:47, 83 --> 00:16:50,333
after we've successfully escaped from here.

172
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,708
I'm tired of doing things that way.

173
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,666
"At any rate" this... or "for the time being" that.

174
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,458
If we keep putting this off like we have been,

175
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,833
we'll have nowhere to go next.

176
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:14, 41
Unless we settle this right here, we can't move on.

177
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,458
How should I put this?

178
00:17:17, 83 --> 00:17:22,125
Regardless of who I was in the past or what I did,

179
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:27,958
I feel that the "me" of the present should take responsibility.

180
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,125
Such commendable words...

181
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:31,875
They don't match you.

182
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:43,916
Fine.

183
00:17:48, 41 --> 00:17:49, 83
Thanks.

184
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,333
Okay, it's set then.

185
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,166
Do it, Neko.

186
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,208
Undo your spell completely.

187
00:17:56,  0 --> 00:17:57,291
No tricks.

188
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,250
You hillbilly samurai!

189
00:19:35,  0 --> 00:19:36,375
Hi, who are you?

190
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,166
Oh...I must've frightened you.

191
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,791
I'm sorry.

192
00:20:15, 41 --> 00:20:18,333
I thought I heard a loud noise just now...

193
00:20:21, 41 --> 00:20:22,791
What? Who?! Are you human?!

194
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26, 41
Uh...hi.

195
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,  0
Are you all right?

196
00:20:29, 41 --> 00:20:31,541
Who are you? Where are you from?

197
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,291
Uh...I'm...

198
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,791
Yashiro...Isana.

199
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,500
Yashiro Isana?

200
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52, 83
That's right...Isana!

201
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,583
What were you doing here...?

202
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,  0
Let me guess...

203
00:20:56,  0 --> 00:20:59,125
You were trying to avoid helping out with the school festival preparations.

204
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,416
Is that what I was doing?

205
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:01,583
Huh?

206
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04, 41
Whoa?! How'd that hole get there?!

207
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,291
Hole? I don't know...

208
00:21:08, 83 --> 00:21:09,500
Don't play dumb!

209
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,833
Huh? Is that all?

210
00:21:17,  0 --> 00:21:18,541
What about my memories before that?

211
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,250
This is where it started!

212
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,125
You were on the ground. You fell from the sky!

213
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,375
He fell to the ground?

214
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,125
I was the first one to find you!

215
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:32,208
I found you! That's why you're mine!

216
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,166
Shiro is Neko's Shiro!

217
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:38,500
You can't bring back memories of before you found me?

218
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41, 41
That's the part I want to know...

219
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,750
If you found out, wouldn't you disappear?

220
00:21:46, 41 --> 00:21:48,166
Wouldn't you no longer be Shiro?

221
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:49,750
Don't worry.

222
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,541
I'm your Shiro, right?

223
00:21:54,  0 --> 00:21:55,916
Okay...I'll try!

224
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Bye!

225
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21, 41
Who...was that?

226
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,750
You got me. Thanks to you, my glasses are loose now.

227
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,166
Furthermore, we must assure prompt apprehension of the suspect.

228
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:19, 41
Next time on K, #07 "KINDLING."

229
00:24:19, 83 --> 00:24:21,125
We stand firm in our resolve.
