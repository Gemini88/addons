1
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,966
That's definitely you...

2
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:56,166
Right?

3
00:02:01,  0 --> 00:02:02,800
Yashiro Isana!

4
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:09,566
By order of the former Seventh King, Ichigen Miwa...

5
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:11,866
I shall have your...

6
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,933
Just a minute!

7
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,166
...life!

8
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:28,166
A-Are you really going to kill me?!

9
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30, 66
Do you intend to resist?

10
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,700
I didn't do it! I'm innocent!

11
00:02:33, 33 --> 00:02:36,900
Did this Miwa person order you to kill an innocent man?!

12
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,766
Innocent?

13
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04, 66
Okay, so...I might not look innocent at the moment...

14
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:06,800
But you know what they say...

15
00:03:07,  0 --> 00:03:10,766
Don't judge a book by its cover. It's what's inside that counts.

16
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,300
It's not a person's appearance, or even what's inside.

17
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:18,200
My policy is to judge a man by his actions.

18
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,500
I'm telling you, that's not me!

19
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,666
You have the wrong guy!

20
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,633
No matter how you look at it, that's you!

21
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29, 66
Stop trying to deny it!

22
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:33,666
Okay, so let's assume for a moment that I really did kill someone.

23
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,266
Why are you trying to kill me?

24
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,200
If you're accusing me of murder,

25
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,666
then shouldn't you just hand me over to the police,

26
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,633
and let a prosecutor and judge determine my guilt?

27
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,833
Isn't that how things should work in this law-abiding country?

28
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,500
I don't serve this country.

29
00:03:52,  0 --> 00:03:53,766
I serve only Master Ichigen Miwa.

30
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,833
I give up. Guess there's no point in arguing.

31
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:03,300
Go ahead and do what you want with me.

32
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,566
You've finally accepted your fateâ€”

33
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,400
But before you do, would you grant me one final request?

34
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,133
Speak.

35
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,266
Mind putting me down first, though?

36
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,633
Don't worry, I won't run.

37
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,400
It'd be useless, anyway.

38
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,466
You'd catch me before I have a chance.

39
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,466
Right?

40
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:34,366
Cool. Thank you very much.

41
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,633
I want to write a farewell letter...

42
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,  0
to my younger sister.

43
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:55,533
Your sister?

44
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,433
Yes, we're very close.

45
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,433
I know I can't prove to you that I'm innocent.

46
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:08,  0
But I don't want my sister to believe...

47
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,433
that I was killed for committing murder.

48
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:18,200
She was born with a serious illness

49
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:20,700
and has lived her whole life in the hospital.

50
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,366
She's never had any friends,

51
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,200
so I'm the only person she can talk to.

52
00:05:28, 66 --> 00:05:33,166
If I'm killed, my sister will be left all alone.

53
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,666
What is your sister's name?

54
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,666
Huh?

55
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,233
Uh, it's...

56
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,333
Marilyn...

57
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:50,600
Uh... Mari. Her name is Mari!

58
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:55,200
Mari Isana. That's a nice name.

59
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,333
Thank you.

60
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,566
It's done.

61
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01, 66
I have a favor to ask.

62
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,166
Can you give this to her for me?

63
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:10,500
Please! There's no one else I can ask.

64
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:14,400
Once I'm gone, she'll have no family to turn to.

65
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:17,166
She'll be all alone.

66
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:21,666
What is this?!

67
00:06:37, 66 --> 00:06:39,133
I LIED.

68
00:06:56,  0 --> 00:06:57,800
I managed to get out of that one.

69
00:06:59,  0 --> 00:07:02,400
Next time, though, he'll kill me on the spot.

70
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,866
Did you put up the bounty notices?

71
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38, 66
I'm sending them out right...now!

72
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,133
NOTICE FROM HOMRA

73
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,700
WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE YOUNG MALE WHO SHOT OUR MEMBER ON THE ROOFTOP OF THE HIRASAKA BUILDNG ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 7TH AROUND 23:45PM.

74
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,500
ANYONE WHO CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION LEADING TO THE SUSPECT'S CAPTURE WILL BE GIVEN A REWARD OF TEN MILLION YEN. What?! Are you serious?!

75
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,533
- That's insane! - Ten million?!

76
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,400
Hello, you've reached HOMRA.

77
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,266
Do you have information regarding the suspect?

78
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,333
Yes, that's correct. Ten million yen.

79
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08, 66
No, we're not joking.

80
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,600
Mind giving us a little credit?

81
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,100
Any luck, Anna?

82
00:08:32, 66 --> 00:08:33,233
Around this area.

83
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,633
Yatagarasu here.

84
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,400
All right. I'm on my way!

85
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,333
I just went into an alley that's not even on the map.

86
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,666
Stop laughing, moron.

87
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,800
Kamamoto here.

88
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,433
I have my hands full at the moment.

89
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,466
Give me a few minutes...

90
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,  0
Hey, can I get a side of fried rice?

91
00:09:12, 33 --> 00:09:13,666
You moron! This is no time for lunch!

92
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:18,833
Hey, what did you just say about HOMRA?

93
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,533
Is someone running their mouth about HOMRA?

94
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,966
Mark the location. I'll head right over!

95
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,100
Try to focus on finding the boy.

96
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,200
Oh, and keep your hands off of the Black Dog.

97
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:34,133
You guys are no match for him.

98
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,466
Kusanagi out.

99
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,300
Mr. Kusanagi, just a minute!

100
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:42,400
Let's hope those boys don't screw this up.

101
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:46,600
Hey, you think that bounty's for real?

102
00:09:47, 33 --> 00:09:48,133
Are you serious?

103
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,433
What would you do with ten million yen?!

104
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:55, 66
It's probably just another stupid prank by those HOMRA kids.

105
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,533
Hey, careful. You don't want to mess with those guys.

106
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,133
Where are you, Yashiro Isana?!

107
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,566
Come out!

108
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:28,833
Hey, Black Dog!

109
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,366
Where the hell is he?

110
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,933
What are you talking about, Red Clansman?

111
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:41, 66
I'm asking where you're hiding that bastard!

112
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,566
If you know what's good for you, answer me!

113
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,433
I don't have time for you.

114
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,233
Move out of the way.

115
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,800
Hey!

116
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:53,900
Yatogami!

117
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,733
It looks like we can get out from up here.

118
00:10:57, 33 --> 00:10:58,300
Get up here, quick!

119
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:00,766
You!

120
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:02,200
It's him!

121
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,933
I'm sure you can take out that guy in an instant.

122
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,533
Just finish him off and come up here.

123
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,400
Don't underestimate me!

124
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:16,  0
Once I'm done with you, I'll tie that idiot down.

125
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:20,433
If you intend to fight me, don't expect any mercy.

126
00:11:21, 66 --> 00:11:22,  0
Fuck you!

127
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:00,366
Are you okay?!

128
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,  0
Yata!

129
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:05,800
He's gone?!

130
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:10,266
Yashiro Isana...

131
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,866
Show some respect!

132
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,300
Oh sorry.

133
00:12:40,  0 --> 00:12:40,833
You're too kind.

134
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,533
Not at all.

135
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,466
I'm beat...

136
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:54,900
Who were those people, anyway?

137
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:57,733
And that video...

138
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:00,933
It seemed so real, like it was actually me.

139
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:06,200
I get the feeling this is gonna be a hassle.

140
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,  0
I know. Especially when life was so good up until now.

141
00:13:32,  0 --> 00:13:33,433
Wh-Who are you?!

142
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,566
I am Neko!

143
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,800
- Show some respect! - Show some respect!

144
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,100
- Die! Die - Show some respect!

145
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,800
- You're too kind! - Die! Die

146
00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,800
You're too kind!

147
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,566
School hours are now over.

148
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,133
I repeat, school hours are now over.

149
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,433
Students not preparing for the school festival

150
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:13, 33
are asked to leave the school grounds immediately.

151
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,333
We're finally done for the day.

152
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:25,800
What's up with him?

153
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,566
He's kind of hot.

154
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,666
You really think so?

155
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,100
I'll just have to force my way through.

156
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:35,866
Excuse me... Can I help you with something?

157
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,866
What's wrong?

158
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:39,200
Friend of yours?

159
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:42,400
No, but he seemed like he needed some help.

160
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,833
I'm looking for a Yashiro Isana.

161
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:47,933
Do you know him?

162
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,633
Isana?

163
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,900
Oh, you mean Shiro?

164
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,166
Sure, he's my classmate.

165
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,  0
Where is he?

166
00:14:56,266 --> 00:15:01,100
Well, he went out to run some errands for me.

167
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,400
But he should be back by now.

168
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:08,166
If you'd like, I could show you to the student dormitory.

169
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:17,600
There we go!

170
00:15:18, 66 --> 00:15:21,633
Follow me. I'll take you to the boys' dorm.

171
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,166
Thank you. I am grateful for your cooperation.

172
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:29,700
You're being so dramatic! I'm just doing what's right.

173
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,700
Not many can do the "right thing" when it counts.

174
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36, 66
That is what my master used to say.

175
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,633
I will not forget what you have done to help me.

176
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,  0
You're a funny guy.

177
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,433
So, how do you and Shiro know each other?

178
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,133
I have something that I must hand over to him.

179
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:55,500
Like something he dropped?

180
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:56,966
His death warrant.

181
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,100
Did you say...wallet?

182
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:00,100
No.

183
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:20,300
H-Here, put this on!

184
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:21,833
I don't want to!

185
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,666
A girl shouldn't run around naked.

186
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,633
Clothes are too restricting. I hate them!

187
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,533
Meow.

188
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:39, 66
You want to play tag? Sure!

189
00:16:40,  0 --> 00:16:41, 66
Sounds like fun!

190
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:45,  0
Hey, Shiro!

191
00:16:46,  0 --> 00:16:48,433
I brought your friend to see you.

192
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,866
Friend?

193
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,133
How's your younger sister doing, Yashiro Isana?

194
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:58,533
Huh?

195
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:00,400
Shiro, you have a sister?

196
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:02,233
I appreciate your showing me here.

197
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,100
My pleasure!

198
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:18,866
I guess he's just as forgetful as Shiro.

199
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:33, 33
No!

200
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,533
What theâ€”?! How indecent!

201
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40, 66
Indecent! So indecent!

202
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,533
Here! Put this on, now!

203
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,600
This way, Shiro.

204
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,300
Huh? What?

205
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,633
Whoa! The hallway went back to normal!

206
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:11,766
Did she do that?!

207
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Never mind. She needs to put on some clothes!

208
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,700
You're not getting away!

209
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:29,966
An illusion?!

210
00:18:48, 66 --> 00:18:49,700
Does she work for him?

211
00:19:22, 66 --> 00:19:23, 66
What was that?

212
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:24,833
Are you okay?

213
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:26,300
Yes...

214
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,  0
It felt like I bumped into something.

215
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,366
Meow.

216
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Not again!

217
00:19:40,  0 --> 00:19:40,933
Here you go.

218
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,333
Thank you.

219
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,500
Give it up, Yashiro Isana!

220
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,266
The game's over.

221
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:09,566
Meow, meow, meow!

222
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,800
This wall's probably an illusion, as well!

223
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,500
Just give it up, Yashiro Isana!

224
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:29,500
- Stop it! Don't chase after Shiro! - I don't want to give up, okay?!

225
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,133
- How indecent! - Come on, put this on!

226
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33, 33
- Anyone who bullies Shiro gets this! - Hey, don't!

227
00:20:33, 66 --> 00:20:34,466
- Meat! - Don't do that!

228
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,966
This is an illusion... An illusion!

229
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:40,633
Huh? Hey, what did you just do to my face?!

230
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,833
You...

231
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,100
finally put it on...

232
00:20:59, 66 --> 00:21:02,633
Evil...King... Yashiro Isana...

233
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:05,866
MEAT STUPID By the order of my late master,

234
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:07,700
I shall...

235
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14, 66
Shiro, I'm hungry.

236
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,666
What do you say...

237
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,166
we set aside this matter for some breakfast?

238
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,366
What?!

239
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,  0
Thank you for agreeing.

240
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,433
I've cooked rice before,

241
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:32,666
but I've never made anything to go with it.

242
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:35,100
Hurry, Shiro.

243
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,833
When is breakfast?

244
00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,366
I'm hungry.

245
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,233
Which one goes in first? Dashi or Miso?

246
00:21:44,  0 --> 00:21:47,333
No! No green onions. I hate green onions.

247
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:49,233
What? But we have to put in green onions.

248
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,566
No yellow onions either!

249
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,  0
I won't put that one in, so don't worry.

250
00:21:52, 33 --> 00:21:54,300
- And no myoga! And no ginger! - Not even that?! Ginger?

251
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,866
And no cilantro!

252
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,733
YOU FORGOT THIS! FROM KUKURI Oh, but I'm fine with garlic chives.

253
00:21:57,766 --> 00:21:59,400
That, you're okay with?!

254
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,666
Oh, oh, I want mine spicy!

255
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,533
- Thank you again. - Let's put lots of hot pepper!

256
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:05,933
- We're not going to put that in. - Yes, we are! I want my mouth to be on fire!

257
00:22:05,966 --> 00:22:07,200
We're not doing that.

258
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,900
Scrape the whites against the bottom of the bowl,

259
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:24,200
tearing, tearing the yolk...

260
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,666
Start from the skin...

261
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:28,233
Mince finely...

262
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:31,866
Eat while it's hot!

263
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,700
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you for the food!

264
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:12, 33
Fresh eggs, soy sauce, and Dashi.

265
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,900
For kids, you can also add a pinch of sugar.

266
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,300
Now mix all of them gently.

267
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:21,  0
Next, add oil to the frying pan, and then pour in the egg mixture.

268
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:24,566
Once the mixture starts to cook, push them to one side of the pan,

269
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,166
and then quickly roll it into its proper shape.

270
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
You roll it, got that?!

271
00:24:31,  0 --> 00:24:33,900
Next time on K, #03 "KITCHEN."

272
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,733
This is how you make a delicious Dashi egg roll.
