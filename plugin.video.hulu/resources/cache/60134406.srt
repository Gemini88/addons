that our family's wealth   had been built on   the suffering of others.

9

That he failed our city,

and that it was   up to me to save it   and right his wrongs.

But to do that   without endangering   the people closest to me,

You're gonna testify in that trial.

163

You're gonna confess to having Victor Nocenti killed.

(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

I hired you to protect my son.

167
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,208
Now, I'm not a professional bodyguard,

168
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,342
but it seems to me that the first requirement would be managing to stay

169
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:45,875
next to the man you're hired to protect.

170
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,175
With all due respect, ma'am, I never had a client who didn't want my protection.

171
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:53,308
I hired you. That makes me the client.

172
00:08:54,475 --> 00:09:00,342
Now where do you think my son is going on these chaperone-less excursions?

173
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:01,942
Ma'am, I truly do not know.

174
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,942
And he truly doesn't.

175
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:05,442
Then perhaps you'd like to share with me

176

182

to the exchanging first names stage...

183

185

There is a maniac out there, hunting the wealthy.

186

That maniac saved my life.

This isn't a game.

188

I lost you once.

I served three tours in Afghanistan, Mr. Queen.

195

You don't even come close to my definition of grief.

196

But I tell you what...

197
00:10:10, 75 --> 00:10:11,575
You ditch me one more time,

198
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:13,942
no one will have to fire me.

199

Where you going?

200
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:24,608
Uh... Somewhere loud and smoky.

201
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,442
And don't bother trying to pickpocket my stash this time,

202

do you think this is what Dad would want for you?

Dead people don't want anything.

206

It's one of the benefits of being dead.

207
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,808
I was dead.

Well, I owe you an apology, Mr. Somers.

215
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,142
We come all the way down to your docks,

216

and it turns out, you don't need the police after all.

from your stevedore, saying that you were getting attacked

220

by a guy in a green hood and a bow and arrow...

221

I guess... Well, was that a practical joke?

Well, you know, I'd be very much inclined

00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:35,642
to believe an honest, upstanding businessman like yourself,

227
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:39,508
except, well, one of my men

228
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:42,908
found this at your docks.

229
00:11:42,908 --> 00:11:46,275
You see, there's this vigilante running around.

230
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:47,742
He thinks he's some kind of Robin Hood.

231
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:50,242
He's robbing the rich, he's trying to teach them a lesson I guess.

232
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,675
I don't know, I don't know. But the point is,

233
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:54,908
the man's a killer.

234
00:11:54,908 --> 00:12:00,775
And nothing, and no one, is going to stop me from bringing him down.

235
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:02,575
But like you said...

236

Hmm!

After all, your daughter is suing me.

You always were so excited.

Come, please sit.

262
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:38,742
Mom, it makes me nervous when you ask me to sit down.

00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,142
by dedicating the building in his name. Nice.

267
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:52,142
And we'd like to make an announcement at the dedication

268
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:55,775
that you will be taking a leadership position in the company.

269
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:58,208
No. No, your... Your company.

324
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,242
are getting around-the-clock police protection. Okay?

325
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:50,375
Get used to their faces,

326
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,408
because they're going with you everywhere you go, no arguments.

327
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:53,842
I'm a lawyer. I live to argue.

328
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:56,942
I'm your father. I live to keep you safe.

329
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,542
Um, Emily, let's go grab a cup of coffee, okay?

330
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:03,442
Yes, why not do that? Thank you. Please, go with them.

331
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:05,108
Stay there.

332
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:07,442
Protective custody?

333
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:10,742
I seem to recall you trying that once I discovered boys also.

334
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:12,275
Didn't work then either. (SIGHING)

335
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,208
This isn't a joke, Laurel.

336
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:17,  8
Martin Somers got attacked last night.

337
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:18,842
What? Yeah.

338
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:20,208
By who? It doesn't matter.

339
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,742
Point is, you have whipped up a storm with these guys,

340
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:26,575
and until the dust settles you'll be protected, okay?

341
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:28,242
End of discussion.

342
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,542
That might have worked when I was eight.

343
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,875
But it's not gonna work anymore.

344
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33, 42
End of discussion, Laurel!

345
00:18:33, 42 --> 00:18:34,942
You're insistent on doing your job, that's great.

346
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:36,142
But this is me doing mine, okay?

347
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:37,642
And not just as a father, but as a cop.

348
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:41,775
These people, they are more dangerous than you are willing to admit.

349
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:44,475
And you've made them angry.

350
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,742
Thank you for coming. Anything for a friend.

351
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:55,908
We're not friends.

352
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:58,208
You smuggle drugs, I let you use my port.

353
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,908
For which you're paid a lot of money.

354
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:02,608
I don't get paid enough to have arrows shot at me.

355
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,442
You need to take this guy seriously.

356
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:07,108
He is a bigger threat to your operation than Nocenti ever was.

357
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:09,608
Except now it's Nocenti's daughter who's the problem.

358
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:13, 75
Unlike your friend with the hood, we know where to find her.

359
00:19:13, 75 --> 00:19:14,108
Don't be an idiot.

360
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:16,975
You take out Emily Nocenti, and Laurel Lance will never let this go.

361
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:18,508
She won't stop until she burns you,

362
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:22, 75
me, and then the entire Triad to the ground.

363
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:24,875
Then we kill Miss Lance.

364
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,375
Attorney for   shipping magnate,   Martin Somers,

365
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,108
has confirmed his client   has no intention   of testifying,

366
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:38,608
maintaining his innocence   in the wrongful death   of Victor Nocenti.

367
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:40,542
Nocenti's body   was found   four weeks ago.

368
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:43,842
We'll keep you updated   as more information   becomes available.

369
00:19:43,842 --> 00:19:45,408
Wait, how did you get those?

370
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:46,742
(SIGHING) Don't you knock?

371
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:50,208
No, wait... Mom said that there were scars, but...

372
00:19:55,208 --> 00:20:00, 75
I'm... Oliver, what happened to you out there?

373
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07, 75
I don't want to talk about it.

374
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:09,142
(SCOFFS)

375
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,342
Of course you don't.

376
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:14,  8
You never want to talk to me about anything.

377
00:20:14,  8 --> 00:20:16,508
Except for my social life. Wait!

378
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,275
Where are you going?

379
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:21,308
Why should I tell you?

380
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:25,742
I'm sorry, Thea.

381
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:32, 75
I need to get better at talking about what happened to me there.

382
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,608
But I'm not ready yet.

383
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:39, 75
Okay?

384
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,175
Do you have a second?

385
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,408
Yeah.

386
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:47,942
Good.

387
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:50,675
I wanna show you something out back.

388
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:57,208
Sometimes, when I felt... Whatever...

389
00:20:57,475 --> 00:20:59,808
I'd come here.

390
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:07,142
About a month after the funerals, Mom stopped going out.

391
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:11,142
Pretty soon, she stopped talking altogether.

392
00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:16, 42
The house got so quiet, so I'd come here.

393
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:19,375
To talk to you.

394
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:23,542
I mean, stupid stuff.

395
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:28,175
Like what I was doing that day, what boy I had a crush on...

396
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:31,  8
And then sometimes, I'd ask you,

397
00:21:31,  8 --> 00:21:35,142
beg you, to find your way home to me.

398
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:36,942
Now, here you are.

399
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:42, 75
And the truth is, I felt closer to you when you were dead.

400
00:21:43, 42 --> 00:21:46,342
Look, I know it was hell where you were.

401
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:48,942
But it was hell here too.

402
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:53,742
You gotta let me in, Ollie.

403
00:21:55,242 --> 00:21:57,942
You gotta let someone in.

404
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:14,342
(DOORBELL RINGING)

405
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,275
Hi.

406
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:33, 42
Are you okay?

407
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:34,375
There are two cop cars outside.

408
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,275
How am I supposed to stay away from you

409
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:38,975
if you won't stay away from me?

410
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:42,208
I... What are you doing here, Ollie?

411
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:43,942
My sister took...

412
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:49,208
She pointed out to me that I have been distant since I got back and that...

413
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:52,542
It would probably be a good idea if I let somebody in.

414
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:56,342
So, you thought you'd start with the first person you pushed away.

415
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,775
I did that to protect you.

416
00:22:59, 42 --> 00:23:00,275
And then I saw you yesterday,

417
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:02,908
and I realized that I hurt you.

418
00:23:04, 75 --> 00:23:05,708
(SIGHING)

419
00:23:11,508 --> 00:23:13, 75
Thank you.

420
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:17,908
Wow.

421
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:21,375
This place hasn't changed in five years. (CHUCKLING)

I'm a jerk.

424
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:32,775
Before the island, I was a jerk, and now I'm just a...

425
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:36,175
I'm a damaged jerk.

What's in the bag?

427
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:41,608
I thought about many things on the island,

428
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:43,842
but there was one thing that I thought about every day.

429
00:23:43,842 --> 00:23:44,975
I actually dreamed about it,

430
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:48,275
and I promised myself that if I ever got a chance

431
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:52,408
to do it again, I'd do it with you.

432
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:58, 75

My mother wants me to join the company.

Yeah. Take my rightful place.

I have plans.

439
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:32,408
I have things that I have to do.

440
00:24:32,408 --> 00:24:35,  8
I can't do that if I'm...

00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:47,908
You can say no.

00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:49,442
Oh, I tried.

447
00:24:49,908 --> 00:24:51,675
Didn't take.

448
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:54,608
Well, then don't tell her.

449
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56, 75
Show her.

450
00:24:56, 75 --> 00:25:00,342

I have plenty of experience with disapproving parents.

I have been on the receiving end of your father's disapproval.

454

He blames himself more than he blames you.

455
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:18, 42
He thinks that, you know, maybe if he and Sarah were closer,

456
00:25:18, 42 --> 00:25:21, 75
she would have told him about the boat trip.

457
00:25:21, 75 --> 00:25:24,908
And he could have stopped her from going with you.

458
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,408
I am sorry.

459
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:28,575
You apologized already.

it will be permanent. Dad!

490

I'd say thank you, but I don't think that would cover it.

00:27:44,342 --> 00:27:47,  8
Well, like I told your cop friend, I was just doing my job.

Besides, I think it should be you that I'm thanking.

It wasn't even weighted properly,

501

yet you threw it with accuracy across a 10-foot room.

and face a court's justice,

you'd stop being just so reckless.

with Mr. Somers' confession, to prosecute him.

647
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,183
He's going to jail, Emily.

648
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:03,550
For the rest of his life.

649
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,616
Thank you so much for fighting for us.

650
00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:09,516
Well, thank you for being brave enough to let me.

651
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17, 16
Hey.

652
00:37:17, 16 --> 00:37:19,383
I thought I didn't need police protection anymore.

653
00:37:19,383 --> 00:37:22,350
I thought I didn't need a reason to see my own daughter.

654
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,950
You don't.

655
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:29,550
Hmm. You look tired.

656
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,483
Yeah, I was filling out reports on the shootout at the port last night

657
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:36,716
and getting grilled about how I let that archer get away.

658
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:39,850
I have to admit, I'm kind of glad he did.

659
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,950
He brought down Martin Somers.

660
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,516
He hurt a bunch of people doing it, okay?

661
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:45,750
He is no hero. He is an anarchist.

662
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48, 16
Yeah, well, whoever he is,

663
00:37:48, 16 --> 00:37:49,516
it seems like he's trying to help.

664
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:51,416
The city doesn't need that kind of help, okay?

665
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:53, 50
It's like I always told you, you don't need to go

666
00:37:53, 50 --> 00:37:55,616
outside the law to find justice. Now I believe that.

667
00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:59,416
All right? And I promise you, when I catch this guy,

668
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:02, 16
he's gonna   believe it, too.

669
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:23, 83
Well, you saw for yourself.

670
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:25,483
My son knows nothing.

671
00:39:25,483 --> 00:39:28,783
Robert didn't tell him anything that could hurt us.

672
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:33, 50
And he has no idea that the yacht was sabotaged.

673
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,916
All that time on the island, plotting my return,

674
00:39:57,916 --> 00:40:02,316
I didn't realize how hard it would be.

675
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:07,850
To reconnect with Mom, Thea,

676
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:12,883
Laurel. Okay, I didn't...

677
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:20,350
I didn't know how painful it would be to keep my secrets.

678
00:40:22, 50 --> 00:40:24,416
You asked me to save the city.

679
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:27, 83
To right your wrongs.

680
00:40:27,316 --> 00:40:28,916
I will.

681
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:31,550
I swear.

682
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,116
But to do that,

683
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:40, 50
I can't be the Oliver that everyone wants me to be,

684
00:40:40, 50 --> 00:40:42,750
which means that sometimes...

685
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,516
To honor your wishes...

686
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:52, 83
I need to dishonor your memory.

687
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:55, 50
I'm sorry.

688
00:40:58, 16 --> 00:40:59,716
(SIGHING)

689
00:40:59,716 --> 00:41:02,416
Take it down.

690
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:13, 83
Will you be going out tonight, sir?

691
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:16,416
Definitely.

692
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,616
(ARROW THUDS) (SCREAMING)

693
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,416
(GROANING LOUDLY)

694
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:49,916
No, no...
