1
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,375
It's those Blues!

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,875
SCEPTER 4 has entered the building.

3
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,500
Munakata, ready!

4
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,250
I'll handle this.

5
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:21,125
In compliance with Protocol 120, I am taking you into custody.

6
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,666
Any objections?

7
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,750
Unfortunately, I have none.

8
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,166
Take good care of me.

9
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,916
Well, look who's here...

10
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,500
Suoh, let's get straight to the point.

11
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:07, 41
Your Weismann level is pushing its limit.

12
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,833
If the Sword of Damocles should fall,

13
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,  0
we'll have a repeat of the Kagutsu crater.

14
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,541
If you insist on drawing more power from the Dresden Slates,

15
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,166
I will have to kill you.

16
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,208
I have no idea what you're talking about.

17
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:27,166
I'm telling you to renounce your throne.

18
00:02:28,  0 --> 00:02:33,208
You're just a stick in the mud, aren't you, Munakata?

19
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,166
If that's your answer,

20
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:39,875
I'll have to come up with a way to keep you locked up for life.

21
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:45,208
Actually, there is one way to keep me locked up here forever.

22
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,791
You could do it, Munakata.

23
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,916
The Blue King can keep an eye on me personally.

24
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,416
24 hours a day, inside this cell.

25
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:02,125
If I become violent, you can restrain me by force.

26
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:07,541
The thought of having to breathe the same air as you makes me ill.

27
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:14,291
And besides, I'm afraid I'm quite busy.

28
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18, 83
I can't spend all my time with you.

29
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,416
I'm sorry you feel that way, Munakata.

30
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,  0
Yeah, me too, Suoh...

31
00:05:09, 83 --> 00:05:12,  0
Restraining him with fire-retardant phenolic resin...

32
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16, 41
That sounds like a good idea.

33
00:05:17,  0 --> 00:05:21, 83
But I don't know how effective it'd be against that man.

34
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:26,708
I do not know what the Red King, Mikoto Suoh, has in mind,

35
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,541
but this gives us a good opportunity.

36
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,  0
If I may be so blunt,

37
00:05:30, 41 --> 00:05:34,125
short of killing him, we should try every available option.

38
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,166
For example, under proper medical supervision,

39
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,916
how about administering doses of muscle relaxant or tranquilizers?

40
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:49,375
That's quite a radical idea and a good one at that, Ms. Awashima.

41
00:05:50, 83 --> 00:05:53,583
Your blatant disregard for Suoh's human rights

42
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55, 83
makes me shudder.

43
00:05:56, 41 --> 00:05:58, 41
All right. I'll consider it.

44
00:06:00, 41 --> 00:06:03,166
Did you learn anything about the weapon used

45
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,666
to murder Tatara Totsuka?

46
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,625
Apparently, it was one of many modified guns

47
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09, 41
that the mafia was dealing.

48
00:06:09, 83 --> 00:06:11,708
The man in charge of their smuggling operation has gone missing,

49
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13, 41
along with the truck.

50
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,166
Was there anything else on that truck?

51
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,791
A few volatile chemicals, explosives,

52
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,625
and enough weapons and ammo to open up a gun shop.

53
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,166
Those bastards...

54
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,958
Well, if the suspects have their hands on that much firepower...

55
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36, 83
Metro P.D. is taking this very seriously,

56
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,500
and is about to form an investigation unit.

57
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,375
I'm thinking of putting in a special request

58
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,125
for a release of information.

59
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,125
Shall I issue the order under Level: Prussian Blue?

60
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,666
No, make it the next level: Royal Blue.

61
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,333
I want to know of every incident

62
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59, 41
that has occurred in this city in the past two weeks,

63
00:06:59, 83 --> 00:07:03,791
as well as everything that may or will happen until this case is solved.

64
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,666
I want every set of eyes and ears you have on this.

65
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,  0
Understood.

66
00:07:08, 41 --> 00:07:11,833
And those who can't handle it have no need for eyes and ears.

67
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,250
It is our duty to manage and make use of them.

68
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:20,  0
You are an exceptional woman, Ms. Awashima.

69
00:07:25, 83 --> 00:07:26,375
How's it coming?

70
00:07:27,  0 --> 00:07:29,625
I'm just about done spicing up the video

71
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31, 41
HOMRA spammed across the net.

72
00:07:32, 83 --> 00:07:34,666
We have the algorithm to manage all the information.

73
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,833
Then, I leaked some gossip questioning the validity of the video.

74
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,375
So far, I've kept it confined to the level

75
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,875
of a well-conceived Internet prank.

76
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,125
How about you?

77
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:50, 41
I'm checking the database for people with criminal records, but...

78
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,458
I'm not getting any hits.

79
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,750
I just hope the Greens don't catch on to this.

80
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,208
All right. I'll be right there.

81
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,416
Can you pass me the soy sauce?

82
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,250
Show your gratitude. For your meal is important.

83
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,958
Now chew and savor.

84
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,916
There you have it. Eat properly.

85
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,541
What was that?

86
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,  0
I see.

87
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31, 83
They do work fast.

88
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33, 41
Nah, don't worry.

89
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,333
As long as the video still exists, it'll get us somewhere.

90
00:08:39,  0 --> 00:08:40,458
Okay, understood.

91
00:08:41,  0 --> 00:08:42,416
Yes, yes...

92
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,875
Thanks.

93
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:51, 83
Although, if the Black Dog joined the other side,

94
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,416
this is going to be a real bitch.

95
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,250
Not to mention we're running out of time.

96
00:09:04, 83 --> 00:09:06,250
What did you just say?!

97
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,166
Shut up!

98
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,541
You fucking pussy!

99
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,875
Uu... I can't breathe.

100
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,375
M-My...bar!

101
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,125
Why don't you try and say it again, huh?

102
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,708
Dammit you guys!

103
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,166
Listen, you punks!

104
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:35,208
This bar was specially imported from a pub in England.

105
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,875
It cost me a fortune!

106
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,166
The scent of ale, cigarettes,

107
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,500
- and the chatter of drunken patrons... - Mr. Kusanagi...

108
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,  0
- are soaked into this fine piece of history. - You're going to crush my skull!

109
00:09:42, 41 --> 00:09:44,333
- With every polishing, - Please, let go!

110
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47, 41
- the luster of the rosewood... - Ow! Oww!

111
00:09:48, 41 --> 00:09:49, 83
So...

112
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,916
Care to tell me how this fight all started, boys?

113
00:09:53, 83 --> 00:09:56,250
Well, this idiot badmouthed Mr. Mikoto!

114
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,166
No, I didn't!

115
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,125
What about Mikoto?

116
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,958
He said Mr. Mikoto crossed over to the Blue!

117
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,791
Give him hell, too, Mr. Kusanagi!

118
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,708
No! That's not true!

119
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,458
- I was just wondering why... - Don't make excuses!

120
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,541
the King let himself be captured without a fight.

121
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,250
- H-Hey! Don't kick me! - Bastard! That's the same thing!

122
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18, 41
- It's completely different! - Yeah? Say it again, and I'll...

123
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,125
Want me to tell you?

124
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24, 83
- Huh? - Huh?

125
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,125
Why Mikoto purposely allowed himself to be captured?

126
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,541
Uh...Yes.

127
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:34,500
If you apologize to my bar with respect, I'll tell you.

128
00:10:35,  0 --> 00:10:36, 83
O-Okay.

129
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,166
- We are sorry. - We are sorry.

130
00:10:39, 83 --> 00:10:40,125
Think about it.

131
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,875
They're trying to confine a guy

132
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,958
who's a natural disaster waiting to happen.

133
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,958
Worst-case scenario,

134
00:10:46,  0 --> 00:10:48,208
the Blue King will have to stay with him at all times.

135
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,833
What would happen then?

136
00:10:51,  0 --> 00:10:52,958
It makes it easier for us to make moves, right?

137
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,  0
Mikoto let himself be captured so we could roam free.

138
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,625
You see, I told you!

139
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,  0
Let's get out there and search for that piece of shit, and the Black Dog!

140
00:11:03, 41 --> 00:11:03,333
Huh?

141
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,166
We won't let Mr. Mikoto down!

142
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,208
R-Right.

143
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,208
See you, Mr. Kusanagi!

144
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,750
I'm counting on you, Yata!

145
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,416
You got it!

146
00:11:12,  0 --> 00:11:13,  0
Liar.

147
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,208
C'mon, cut me some slack.

148
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,  0
It's sort of true.

149
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,458
By the way,

150
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,583
I wanted to ask you, while I have the chance...

151
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:29, 41
Who were those fire guys who came chasing after me?

152
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,166
Their fellow clansman was killed.

153
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,375
Now, they're out for revenge.

154
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,166
Clansman?

155
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,541
Like a motorcycle gang or the mafia?

156
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,125
A clan is a group of people who serves under their king.

157
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47, 83
Clansmen are the members of that group.

158
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,791
Mikoto Suoh, the Red King, is the king of the third clan.

159
00:11:53, 83 --> 00:11:55,958
Of all the kings, he is the most violent-tempered.

160
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,416
So you're saying he's the boss of a group of people with psychic powers?

161
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02, 83
And that there are other groups like his?

162
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04, 83
I'm being mistaken

163
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,  0
for the guy who murdered one of their members, huh?

164
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:11,166
Not mistaken for... you  are  the murderer.

165
00:12:12,  0 --> 00:12:14,375
After we're done eating, I'm killing you.

166
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,750
What?!

167
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,208
More!

168
00:12:20,  0 --> 00:12:22,166
Then I'll have more, too!

169
00:12:28, 83 --> 00:12:32,208
Well, this is going to be the last bowl of white rice you'll ever eat.

170
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,458
Hey, wait a minute!

171
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,125
Found them!

172
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,125
Over here, too!

173
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,833
This is the missing gun dealer's spot, all right!

174
00:12:56, 41 --> 00:12:58,333
How the hell does Mr. Kusanagi get a hold

175
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,166
of this kind of information, anyway?

176
00:13:02,  0 --> 00:13:03,500
Rumor has it that

177
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,666
this dealer isn't the only guy who mysteriously disappeared.

178
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,333
Looks like Mr. Kusanagi made the connection

179
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,916
between them and Totsuka's murder.

180
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18, 83
I'm gonna need to hear more about what you just said, scumbag.

181
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,166
What the hell?!

182
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,166
Y-You're...!

183
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,583
Who is this guy?

184
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,666
He's Fushimi!

185
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,958
That guy who betrayed us?!

186
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,833
Guess he's not here...

187
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,375
I found the missing gun dealer's warehouse.

188
00:13:45, 83 --> 00:13:48, 83
Tell Lieutenant Awashima and clean up this mess.

189
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51, 83
Show some respect.

190
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,666
You're too kind.

191
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,583
Moving onward.

192
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:05,166
I understand now why those people are after me.

193
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,791
But why do you want to kill me?

194
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,375
It's not like you're one of them.

195
00:14:13, 41 --> 00:14:15,750
It's because I am the vassal

196
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,291
of the previous Seventh King, the Colorless King.

197
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,583
Colorless?

198
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,291
It means one who is not beholden to a color.

199
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,458
My late master ordered me to evaluate

200
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
the man who would be the next King,

201
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30, 83
and to kill him without hesitation if he is evil.

202
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:34, 41
Master Ichigen Miwa, the previous King,

203
00:14:34, 83 --> 00:14:36,166
possessed the ability to predict the future.

204
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,916
The ability to see the future...

205
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,958
The Colorless King...

206
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,208
For starters, what is this "King" you keep talking about?

207
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,  0
One endowed with great power

208
00:14:46, 41 --> 00:14:49,  0
that embodies the natural laws of this world.

209
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52, 41
The power of the king is what runs this country.

210
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,291
Ordinary human beings would not know of this, however.

211
00:14:56,333 --> 00:15:00,916
I thought the Prime Minister was the most powerful man in this country.

212
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,666
Yes, yes. I will see to it. Yes.

213
00:15:05,  0 --> 00:15:08,208
Yes, as you wish. Goodbye.

214
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:12,708
Mr. Prime Minister.

215
00:15:14,  0 --> 00:15:16,250
Here is the official document to issue Level: Royal Blue.

216
00:15:17, 83 --> 00:15:20, 41
I already received a call from His Excellency regarding that matter.

217
00:15:21, 83 --> 00:15:23, 83
Both Captain Munakata and His Excellency

218
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,416
value regulation above all else.

219
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,125
SCEPTER 4 will now institute the Yuishiki System.

220
00:15:32, 41 --> 00:15:35,583
For two weeks, the people will be disenfranchised of their rights.

221
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,875
I hope you understand.

222
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39, 41
We don't have the right of refusal.

223
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,250
You're well aware of that.

224
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,875
Just following regulations, sir.

225
00:15:45, 41 --> 00:15:46,208
Good grief...

226
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49, 41
Even though we have no choice,

227
00:15:49, 83 --> 00:15:51,750
it's not easy going along with the King's whimsical decisions.

228
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:57,  0
RECHARGING - ONE MOMENT - Today, this country's government... -  One moment please.

229
00:15:57,  0 --> 00:15:59,166
RECHARGING - ONE MOMENT - and economy cannot function... -  One moment please.

230
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,708
without the power of one man.

231
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04, 41
It was because of him that Japan was able to transform

232
00:16:04, 83 --> 00:16:07,166
from a once-defeated nation, preyed upon by its neighbors,

233
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:12, 41
into the world's greatest economic and technological power.

234
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,750
Who is he?

235
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,541
He is known as the Golden King.

236
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,  0
His influence extends to all aspects of society.

237
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21, 41
For example...

238
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,  0
Both of these were made by companies

239
00:16:24,  0 --> 00:16:26, 83
controlled by the Golden King.

240
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29, 41
The boss of those fire guys...

241
00:16:29, 83 --> 00:16:31, 41
You called him the Red King, didn't you?

242
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,125
So there's a Red and Gold King?

243
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,166
There are seven kings.

244
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37, 41
Seven?

245
00:16:37, 83 --> 00:16:39,375
Each clan is completely different

246
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,  0
depending on the King who rules them.

247
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,708
If I were to describe the Red Clan in a word, it would be...

248
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,208
Violence.

249
00:16:50, 83 --> 00:16:51,375
What the hell...

250
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,583
I rushed over because I heard

251
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,250
there was trouble with the guy who killed Totsuka...

252
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,458
These were the guys you meant?

253
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,208
Damn you, punk!

254
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,958
What do you think you're doing?!

255
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04, 41
Yata...

256
00:17:04, 83 --> 00:17:08,166
Help me out here. These guys won't go away!

257
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,708
They want me to tell them about you!

258
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13, 83
Get lost.

259
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,250
You heard me, get lost.

260
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,291
Or else you're going to be in a lot more pain.

261
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,375
Fuck you!

262
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:25,  0
So you guys want to know about us?

263
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,750
Then, I'll tell you.

264
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,750
I'm HOMRA. We are HOMRA.

265
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,125
Mr. Mikoto taught us that.

266
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,  0
This represents our pride...

267
00:17:42, 41 --> 00:17:44, 83
Hey, jerk offs.

268
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,916
I'm giving you a good story here...

269
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,458
Pay attention!

270
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,166
What should we do to them, Yata?

271
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,625
As much as we can without killing them.

272
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:06,125
They're a clan with bonds that run thicker than blood.

273
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:10,500
Killing one of their members was an awfully stupid thing to do,

274
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,166
King-to-be.

275
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,375
Look! I keep telling you it was someone who looks like me!

276
00:18:16, 83 --> 00:18:20,125
I'm not the "King" you talk about, and I've never killed anyone!

277
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24, 83
- See those men?! - Yes...

278
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,250
- They trashed my place! - Oh, is that so?

279
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,  0
Are you listening to me?!

280
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,416
- Business is shot for the night! - Yes, over at the shopping district.

281
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,291
- Why don't you two come to my shop?! - There was an assault.

282
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,125
- I'll open just for you. - Please send back up.

283
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37, 41
No, that's all right.

284
00:18:37, 83 --> 00:18:38,750
- Looks like I just missed them... - Oh, come on..

285
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,791
Stop by again, okay?

286
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,375
Why...?

287
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07, 83
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

288
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,916
Thank you for the meow.

289
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,583
Okay, time to kill you.

290
00:19:15, 83 --> 00:19:18,  0
Wait, wait! This isn't right!

291
00:19:18, 41 --> 00:19:19,500
Let's think about this rationally.

292
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22, 41
Your reason for wanting to kill me

293
00:19:22, 83 --> 00:19:25,208
is because I am the evil Colorless King, correct?

294
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,375
Based on what?

295
00:19:27,  0 --> 00:19:28,166
That video.

296
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,250
That could've easily been faked!

297
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,208
Don't you think it's strange?

298
00:19:33,  0 --> 00:19:36,583
Why would I purposely identify myself as the Colorless King?

299
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,208
Because you're evil and want to show it.

300
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,666
If so!

301
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,875
I messed with that group of dangerous people.

302
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,583
By now, wouldn't I have run away to someplace a lot safer.

303
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,541
Wouldn't I?

304
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,750
I keep telling you,

305
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,541
I'm just an ordinary high school student!

306
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,125
Then, who is that?

307
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,750
Isn't she one of your Clansmen?

308
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,708
Huh? No, she's uh....

309
00:20:05, 41 --> 00:20:06,916
Who exactly are you?

310
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,791
Or...what are you?

311
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,375
I am Neko.

312
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,208
Could she be a Strain?

313
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,125
Then is it purely coincidence that she's here?

314
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,583
No, that can't be...

315
00:20:20, 41 --> 00:20:21,  0
Strain?

316
00:20:22, 41 --> 00:20:25, 41
There are those who possess special powers

317
00:20:25, 83 --> 00:20:27,625
without receiving them from a king.

318
00:20:28, 41 --> 00:20:29,  0
Is that what you are?

319
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:34,  0
I don't quite understand it, but I am Shiro's cat...

320
00:20:34, 83 --> 00:20:36,125
and Shiro is mine!

321
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,  0
- Thanks, I guess... - I am Shiro's cat, and Shiro is mine!

322
00:20:42, 83 --> 00:20:43,958
Listen, Kuroh Yatogami...

323
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,166
I'm being falsely accused here!

324
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,333
I'm going to prove my innocence to you!

325
00:20:51, 41 --> 00:20:54,750
And I'll clear up the misunderstanding with those scary people.

326
00:20:55, 83 --> 00:20:58,  0
I swear...I haven't killed anyone!

327
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,625
Didn't your late master tell you to kill me

328
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,500
after you made a precise evaluation?

329
00:21:04, 83 --> 00:21:06,791
Then determine with your own eyes!

330
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09, 41
Whether I am good...or evil!

331
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14, 41
Push a button.

332
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,  0
Huh?

333
00:21:15,  0 --> 00:21:16,125
Just do it.

334
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18, 83
Okay...then...

335
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,375
Do not judge the cold

336
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23, 83
Without first knowing the warmth Of the shining sun

337
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27, 83
What is that?

338
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,291
It means don't jump to judgment.

339
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:35,875
Looks like you just got a new lease on life, Yashiro Isana.

340
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,666
Just Shiro is fine.

341
00:21:38, 83 --> 00:21:42,375
Mind if I call you Kuro?

342
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,666
Yashiro Isana...

343
00:21:45, 83 --> 00:21:48,125
As you wish, from this moment on,

344
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50, 41
I will determine what kind of person you are.

345
00:21:50, 83 --> 00:21:53,750
If I find that you are evil, I will slay you without hesitation.

346
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,625
Do we understand each other?

347
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,791
Thank you, Kuro.

348
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,166
That's good enough for now.

349
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,750
Thank Master Ichigen for admonishing me.

350
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,208
What is that voice recorder?

351
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,625
You mean this?!

352
00:22:09,  0 --> 00:22:12,500
This contains the recorded words of my late Master Ichigen.

353
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:16,250
The words of Master Ichigen, who was also an avant-garde poet,

354
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,791
were so filled with deep meaning and beauty

355
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,  0
that simply engraving them into my soul was not enough,

356
00:22:21,  0 --> 00:22:23,500
so I recorded them at every opportunity.

357
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,  0
To this day, whenever I am unsure,

358
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,833
Walk casually

359
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,708
Along the path you have chosen The path to your dreams

360
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,250
There you have it.

361
00:22:35,  0 --> 00:22:35,916
Creepy!

362
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,791
Hey there!

363
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,  0
It's me! That's right, Neko!

364
00:24:14,  0 --> 00:24:15, 83
I'm feeling great!

365
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:19,208
But these clothes...are killing me!

366
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22, 83
Things would be much better if there were no clothes at all!

367
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,500
Hey, that's it!

368
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:29,125
Next week, I'll use my powers to make those two completely naked!

369
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:33,  0
Next time on K, #04 "Knock-on effect."

370
00:24:33, 41 --> 00:24:34, 41
Don't worry!

371
00:24:34, 83 --> 00:24:36, 83
They'll have their clothes on for the DVD release!
