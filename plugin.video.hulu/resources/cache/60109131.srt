- I don't believe what I'm hearing.

171
00:12:03, 90 --> 00:12:04,191
Are you friends with them?

172
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:05,626
- and we're friends with him.

173
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,562
- Yeah, it took a little getting used to for us to, you know?

174
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10, 63
Did you know she was coming?

175
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,131
- No.

176
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,399
- Juliette is in real danger, Nick,

177
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:13,667
and we don't have much time.

178
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,703
- Who's Juliette? - Oh, wow, so you two

179
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,306
really haven't caught up in any significant way, I guess.

180
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:20,507
- Juliette's my girlfriend.

181
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,309
- and she's in a coma because of a hexenbiest.

182
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:23,710
- the hexenbiest that Nick destroyed

183
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,479
with our help, by the way, just, you know, for the record.

184
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:27,281
- Nick, the spell is called  l'esprit ailleurs.

185
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,550
- Literally: Spirit elsewhere.

186
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,351
Oddly apropos. - It causes memory loss

187
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,986
with symptoms similar to dementia.

188
00:12:33, 53 --> 00:12:35,422
- So it's imperative that we stop the progression,

189
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37, 57
like, asap. Right now.

190
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,258
- But we have all the ingredients.

191
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,693
We have them mixed and they're cooking,

192
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,495
but it takes 16 hours for it to be ready.

193
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:43,330
- will it bring her out of the coma?

194
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:44,565
- It's way more complicated.

195
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,401
Our first step is just to stop the memory loss.

196
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,470
- Okay, just do whatever you have to do.

197
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,706
- I'm so--I'm so sorry this happened to Juliette.

198
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,476
- And, uh...sort of nice to meet you.

199
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,314
Dude, I gotta be honest,

200
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,418
your mother scares the crap out of me, man.

201
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,254
- Look, you two should probably just keep your distance

202
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,356
until I figure out what I'm dealing with in there.

203
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:11,458
- Yeah. No. Totally, I mean, family reunions can be brutal.

204
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14, 27
Our last one, we lost two cousins and a sheepdog.

205
00:13:14, 94 --> 00:13:15,329
- Okay. - I mean,

206
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,531
no one missed the cousins, you know, they're--

207
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,137
- This is Juliette?

208
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,942
She's very pretty.

209
00:14:02,  9 --> 00:14:05, 45
How long have you been together?

210
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,449
- Where have you been for 18 years?

211
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:15, 88
- More places than I care to remember.

212
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,591
- why don't you try?

213
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:19,660
- I went after those responsible

214
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:22,763
for killing your father and my friend.

215
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,366
- For 18 years?

216
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,135
- I had no idea how long it would take.

217
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,503
Or where it would lead

218
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,573
or how many times I'd be misled and deceived.

219
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,342
When I learned about the secret order, the Dragon's tongue,

220
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37, 10
that they were after the coins,

221
00:14:37, 77 --> 00:14:38,612
I knew there was more at stake than just finding the killers.

222
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,480
I had to deal with the royal families

223
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,115
who are trying to regain the control

224
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,384
they had in the last century.

225
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,153
A lot of the turmoil in the world today

226
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,355
is instigated by their agents.

227
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:51, 58
- Like the verrat.

228
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:54,394
- You're learning. That's good.

229
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,697
I wish I could have been the one who taught you.

230
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,699
When I learned that a Grimm had the coins,

231
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,200
I was hoping it wasn't you.

232
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,502
I often wonder how I could have

233
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,605
done things differently that night, but...

234
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,409
Kimura led me to you, and that's all that matters.

235
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,111
- What about the coins?

236
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,680
- They've already taken up too much of our lives.

237
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,516
They need to be destroyed.

238
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,284
The sooner you give them to me, the better.

239
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,486
It's the only way I can protect you now.

240
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,463
[knocking at door]

241
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,600
- Where's Adalind?

242
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,235
- Why would you think I know where she is?

243
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,171
- You're her mother. - That's a little old-school,

244
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,705
even for you.

245
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,274
- She's gone.

246
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,475
She played one last little trick.

247
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,343
She put Nick's girlfriend in a coma.

248
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,212
- and I care about that why?

249
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,347
- Because it concerns me.

250
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,716
- Can you really blame Adalind after what he did to her?

251
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,585
- Yes!

252
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:54,321
She should stay out of things that she does not understand.

253
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,190
- Well, maybe you played with her heart

254
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,492
a little too freely and that confused her.

255
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,928
- No, she knew exactly what she was doing.

256
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02, 29
- Why do you care what happens

257
00:16:02, 95 --> 00:16:03,597
to Detective Burkhardt's girlfriend?

258
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:07,401
- Because she ties him here...

259
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,136
to Portland, to me,

260
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:11,138
and if she dies he could quit the force, he could leave,

261
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:13,974
and I have put too much time and effort into him

262
00:16:14, 41 --> 00:16:16, 76
to allow that to happen.

263
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,179
Now, I need to know what Adalind did.

264
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,651
A Grimm on his own is dangerous for all of us.

265
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,254
And I'm holding you personally responsible,

266
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,323
and believe me,

267
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,391
you don't want that.

268
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,474
- that's amazing-- Based on a pair of boots

269
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,376
you could find out where the guy lived.

270
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,479
- Yeah. And his cabin is way out there.

271
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:55, 15
I don't think Nick could have found it without me.

272
00:16:55, 82 --> 00:16:56,984
- You went there with Nick?

273
00:16:57, 50 --> 00:16:58,652
I thought you went there with Hank.

274
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,389
- I did.

275
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,491
Yeah.

276
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,733
- Nick?

277
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37, 90
- [roars]

278
00:18:04, 84 --> 00:18:07,221
- Oh, crap, the toast.

279
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,156
- I got it.

280
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,391
- Thanks.

281
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,260
I was just trying to

282
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:16,430
make you a little... something.

283
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,298
[cell phone ringing] I'm sorry.

284
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:19,299
- for what?

285
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:23,370
- a lot of things on that list.

286
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:24,471
- Burkhardt.

287
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,573
Where?

288
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,444
On my way.

289
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,946
So I've got an investigation.

290
00:18:33, 13 --> 00:18:34, 81
Gotta run.

291
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,454
You gonna be here when I get back?

292
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,289
- Yes.

293
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55, 68
- Hey. How you holding up?

294
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,436
- All right.

295
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58, 71
- It's gonna be okay, man.

296
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,506
Juliette's gonna come out of it, she's strong.

297
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,408
- I hope you're right.

298
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,442
- I am.

299
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,380
I may not be awake, but I'm right.

300
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,195
Who's the ship registered to?

301
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:23,397
- Holding company based in rotterdam.

302
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,464
- Oh, it's a foreign ship.

303
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,899
The feds are gonna have jurisdiction.

304
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:26,900
Have they been notified? - Yeah.

305
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,235
They're on their way.

306
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:29,303
- Who reported it?

307
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,604
- Harbor master was called last night.

308
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,440
Three of them went inside. Nobody came out.

309
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:36, 43
Bodies weren't discovered until 6:15 this morning

310
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,544
by one of the security guards.

311
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,179
He was pretty shook up by what he saw

312
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:42,482
and I gotta tell you, this one is, uh...

313
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,118
well, I hate to ruin the surprise.

314
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,362
- What the hell did this?

315
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:59,399
- Something out of my worst nightmare.

316
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,673
- I don't think this container was used

317
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,510
to lock anyone out.

318
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,279
It was used to lock something in.

319
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:26,593
- We ran the ship's logs, found out the container

320
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,395
was loaded at le havre two weeks ago.

321
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:31,532
- Name on the ship manifest is G.Q.R. Industries.

322
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:32,966
- Who are they and what do they do?

323
00:20:33, 33 --> 00:20:34,301
- It looks like a holding company.

324
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:36,503
We don't know much more than that.

325
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39, 72
- We contacted French police. Waiting on a reply.

326
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,241
[desk phone beeps] - Uh-Huh.

327
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,242
Yeah?

328
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,211
- Sir, the FBI agents are here.

329
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:45,546
- Send 'em in.

330
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47, 80
You know the feds are taking over this, right?

331
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:48,348
- Sir, I think that might be a mistake.

332
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,449
- It's not up to us.

333
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:50,317
Just collect whatever you've done,

334
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:52,186
pass it to them. [knocking]

335
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54, 54
- Special agents Kanigher and Durwell.

336
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,289
This is Captain Renard,

337
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:57,324
dDtectives Griffin and Burkhardt.

338
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:58,659
- hell of a mess we're giving you.

339
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,260
- Yeah, we just came from down there.

340
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,396
You did a fine job securing the location.

341
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,298
- Yeah, we appreciate it. What do you got for us?

342
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,465
- All the prelim we could get.

343
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,502
- Look, we might be able to be of some help.

344
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,637
- that's okay, detective, we'll take it from here.

345
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,339
We've already got a line: Security guard's truck

346
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:14,241
was stolen last night from the docks.

347
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:15,576
- If this killer's driving it, we'll get him.

348
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,377
- Well, I understand that, but there are aspects of--

349
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,613
- Hey, Nick.

350
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,515
Detective.

351
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,419
- Thank you.

352
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,521
Gentlemen.

353
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:37, 30
- Here's how it's gonna go.

354
00:21:37, 97 --> 00:21:40,  0
First thing tomorrow, you'll be arraigned for double homicide.

355
00:21:40, 67 --> 00:21:41,702
A few hours after that you'll be transferred

356
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,303
to a maximum security facility

357
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,405
where you will await trial, be found guilty,

358
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,374
and sentenced to death.

359
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:48,675
Now, obviously, I will derive

360
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,244
a certain amount of pleasure from that,

361
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,412
seeing as I can't attend to you myself.

362
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:56,717
- Then maybe you shouldn't have arrested me.

363
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,752
- if I'd have gotten to you first,

364
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,287
I wouldn't have.

365
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:02,356
- Why are you here?

366
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:09,429
- I've seen the tattoos on your back.

367
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,499
I know who you're working for.

368
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:15,  2
Too bad you didn't know you were going up against a Grimm.

369
00:22:15, 68 --> 00:22:19,373
- So you know what I am.

370
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,942
- It would have been better for you

371
00:22:22,  9 --> 00:22:25, 12
had you known what I am.

372
00:22:25, 78 --> 00:22:27,281
At least now I know who has the coins.

373
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,951
- I would have gotten them.

374
00:22:31, 18 --> 00:22:33,287
I knew there was one Grimm.

375
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,455
I didn't know there were two.

376
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:01,181
- Mom?

377
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:04,251
- I did a little cleaning up.

378
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:06,253
Sorry, habit.

379
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,122
- right.

380
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:11,525
- hope it's okay. - Yeah.

381
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:13,427
Thanks.

382
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:19,299
Hey, look. I've been thinking about everything,

383
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,168
and...

384
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:23,337
I think I need to take you somewhere.

385
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:35,482
- I never thought I'd see this again.

386
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,287
- You know about this?

387
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:42,155
- Marie and I bought this trailer

388
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:43,423
when our dad got sick.

389
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,993
We needed a place to hide everything

390
00:23:46, 59 --> 00:23:48,362
that had been passed on to us.

391
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:51,198
We had 17 trunks hidden in the basement of our house.

392
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:54,434
- Who else in our family had this...

393
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,602
problem?

394
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,305
- that I know of?

395
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:00,240
Your grandfather,

396
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:03,243
your great-grandmother, and aunt Marie.

397
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,212
- And uncle George had it too? - No.

398
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07, 47
Not everyone does.

399
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,550
In fact, nobody knows when it's gonna hit them

400
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,118
or even if they've got it.

401
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:13,253
Women become aware sooner than men, But the only thing

402
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,355
we know for sure is, it's inherited.

403
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:32,539
There are a lot of people

404
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:35,642
who'd like to get their hands on this stuff.

405
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:40,614
- What did you think when you first found out about...

406
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:42,382
you know, all of this?

407
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:45,118
- I was only ten years old.

408
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,989
Your grandfather didn't even try to protect me,

409
00:24:49, 56 --> 00:24:50,657
so as soon as the nightmares started, he wanted me

410
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:54,661
to know exactly what I was gonna be up against.

411
00:24:57,598 --> 00:25:00,567
I was so scared, I didn't sleep for months.

412
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:03,270
When I turned 18,

413
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:06,340
he took Marie and me on the hunts.

414
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:08,275
The first couple were horrifying,

415
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,277
But, uh, we quickly realized

416
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:15,616
that we were doing what had to be done.

417
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:19,620
We spent hours poring over these books.

418
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,723
[inhales]

419
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,460
you know, I--

420
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,128
I never wanted this for you.

421
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:31,465
- It's not as if you had much of a choice.

422
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:36,370
- Lot of history here.

423
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:43,243
Your great-Great-Grandmother Hilda, with this blade,

424
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,712
castrated a rotznasig carcaju.

425
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47, 14
[blade sings into scabbard]

426
00:25:47, 80 --> 00:25:49,216
- That's good times. [chuckles]

427
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,686
- You know, this is all very important to us.

428
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:30,324
- Now what?

429
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,492
- Uh...

430
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,228
return them to the island of Zakynthos

431
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:35,262
where they were forged.

432
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:39,233
It's the only way to destroy them.

433
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,936
- So I guess you'll be leaving.

434
00:26:43,  3 --> 00:26:46,106
You know, I guess I understand more now than--

435
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:54, 81
Look, you know, I have seen

436
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:56,183
a lot of things.

437
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:59,686
And you know, I cannot judge

438
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:02, 22
the decisions that you had to make.

439
00:27:02, 89 --> 00:27:04,291
But you know, I just wish I didn't have to

440
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:06,393
grow up without you.

441
00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:09,696
- So do I.

442
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,602
- [sniffles]

443
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,246
maybe you can help me.

444
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,215
- What is it?

445
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:30,250
- An investigation I'm working on.

446
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:33,287
I want you to look at this.

447
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:34,288
- Where is this?

448
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:35,956
- a container on a cargo ship

449
00:27:36, 23 --> 00:27:37,224
that left le havre two weeks ago.

450
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,326
- Do you know what the scythe means?

451
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:41,395
- Yeah. Reapers.

452
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:43,163
- and you've dealt with one?

453
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45, 98
- Actually, I've dealt with three.

454
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,500
- was one of them French?

455
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,302
- We didn't do too much talking.

456
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:50,704
- Then you were the one who returned the heads to mannheim.

457
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:53,173
- You know about that?

458
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55, 42
- News travels fast.

459
00:27:57,477 --> 00:27:59,279
- No, I don't think that is reapers.

460
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,614
- No, no, no.

461
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,549
No, something else drew those.

462
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:05, 85
And if it's what I think it is...

463
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,290
it's worse than reapers.

464
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:13,393
I hope I'm wrong about this.

465
00:28:20,  0 --> 00:28:22,503
Were there any puncture wounds?

466
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:24,605
- There were a lot of wounds.

467
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,912
- We need to go.

468
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:33,947
- Well, what about the coins?

469
00:28:34, 14 --> 00:28:36, 49
- Just put them away.

470
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:38,151
I need to see the bodies.

471
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:45,592
[whip cracking, whimpering]

472
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,227
- [grunts] - Hold on.

473
00:28:47,294 --> 00:28:49,329
- [coughing]

474
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,133
- As you can see, your friends in the resistance

475
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,569
aren't helping you, so why are you helping them?

476
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:57, 70
Hmm?

477
00:28:57,137 --> 00:28:59,706
I personally hate to resort to such medieval methods

478
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:02,242
and would much prefer you join me for supper.

479
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,644
We're having a very nice lafite,

480
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,280
and I'd like to toast your health.

481
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:09,550
All you have to do is give us their names,

482
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:13,253
and you will walk out of here.

483
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,390
Well, maybe crawl out now, but at least you'll be out.

484
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:17,491
[cell phone ringing]

485
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:19, 59
why don't you think about that

486
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:20,494
while I take this call.

487
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:24,364
Bonjour, mon Ami.  How was the voyage?

488
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:28,202
- [speaking French]  tres bien.  I have seen him.

489
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:29,303
- and?

490
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:31,138
- It will be over soon.

491
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:32,272
- The families will be very pleased.

492
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,174
- [screams]

493
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:37,277
- I am  on the phone!

494
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:42,249
Is there anything else that you need?

495
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:43,584
- No.

496
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45, 85
I'll call you when it is done.

497
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:47,321
- I'll look forward to it.

00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,542
- can I help you?

499
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:11,645
- I have a list.

500
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:23,290
- I have everything except for the  pseudomonas aeruginosa.

501
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:24,424
- I need it.

502

- It might take me a couple of days to--

- [roars]

504
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:30,163
Now would be better.

505
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,266
- I'll see what I can do.

506
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:36, 69
- Give me a call when you have it.

507
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:38,438
I'll give you my number.

508
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:50,184
- This is the security guard and the killer stole his truck

509
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,385
and I want to warn you,

510
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:53,654
it's a little rough.

511
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,756
Or not.

00:30:59,793 --> 00:31:01,762
You know what this is?

513
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:08,435
- Something with teeth this big?

514
00:31:08,502 --> 00:31:10, 70
There's not a lot of choices.

515
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:11,104

it's a vicious killing machine.

00:31:16,476 --> 00:31:18,579
One of them can wipe out an entire village,

520
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:20,414
but you better be careful.

521
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,316
Mauvais dentes is like a cat.

522
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:25,319
He'll watch, he'll wait.

523

If he figures out you're coming after him,

00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:29,323
he'll do something to draw you in.

Yeah. - Hey, Nick.

00:31:39, 99 --> 00:31:40,534
It's me and Rosalie. We're in the shop.

529
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:43, 70
Weird thing just happened.

530
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:45,  5
- I just got an order from a hexenbiest.

531
00:31:45, 72 --> 00:31:46,740
And the few things on her list

532
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:48,709
are the same that we're using for Juliette.

533
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:50,677
- So we looked it up in a couple of Rosalee's books,

534
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,579
and we think we figured out what she's doing.

535
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:54,381
- It's a wake-up potion for somebody

536
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:56,483
in Juliette's condition. I mean, this could

537
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58, 85
just be a coincidence, but-- - Totally.

538
00:31:58,151 --> 00:31:59,186
We thought we should tell you anyway.

539
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:00,387
- Well, who was it?

540
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:01,522
- I didn't get a good look at her,

541
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,323
but Rosalee got her number, didn't you?

542
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,391
- Yeah. - Okay, give it to me,

00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06, 26
I can get her address from her number.

I don't know where.

548
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,978
Obviously, she doesn't want anybody to find her.

549
00:32:25, 45 --> 00:32:26,580
But there may be a way to reverse

00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:28,415
what she's done to Juliette.

551
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:29,716
- Good. Then do it.

552
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32, 19
- It's not the preparation that concerns me.

553

It's how it's given to her.

- Not "what." who.

I said, where's your daughter?

- You're the Grimm who destroyed her.

We haven't spoken since that night.

Don't you need a warrant to be doing this, detective?

568
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:14,361
- if I was here as a cop, yeah.

- She is not here.

I have no reason to protect her anymore.

- Well, then find her.

00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:21,602
Or things are gonna get a little dangerous here for you.

573
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:23,303
- Are you threatening me?

574
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,672
- I'm sorry. I must have done it badly.

575
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:29,276
I thought I made myself pretty obvious.

576
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:32,646
If Juliette dies...

577
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:34,748
you're done.

578
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:46,293
- She said she doesn't know where Adalind is.

579
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,195
- Did you threaten to kill her?

580
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:49,296
- Yeah, of course.

581
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:50,597
- Want me to take a crack at her?

582
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:52,199
- No, she's telling me the truth.

583
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:54,968
- I didn't think that was possible for a hexenbiest.

584
00:33:55, 35 --> 00:33:56,603
Was she involved in trying to kill aunt Marie?

00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,472
- Not that I know of.

00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,574
The only person I saw was Adalind.

587
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:02,242
- Why would she try to kill her?

- I don't know.

00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,282
did aunt Marie give you anything?

00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:10,551
- Yeah.

592
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12, 19
A key.

593
00:34:12, 85 --> 00:34:13,287
I have no idea what it's for,

594
00:34:13,353 --> 00:34:16,957
it doesn't open anything in the trailer, but...

595
00:34:17, 24 --> 00:34:18,192
the sides of it make a...

- Map.

00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:24,398
Where is it?

[speaking French]

599
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:52,526
- I only discovered these by accident

00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,207
- What are you doing?

603
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09, 42
- Oh, damn!

604
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:14,548
- Okay, that was cool.

605
00:35:20, 20 --> 00:35:22,322
What is that?

606
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:25,492
- A page from one of the first diaries ever kept by one of us.

607
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,330
You see, legend has it that there are seven keys.

608
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:31,565
- Seven?

609
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:33,267
- Forged by knights who fought

610
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,536
for the seven royal families in the fourth crusade.

611
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:38,972
Now, when you put the maps together,

612
00:35:39, 39 --> 00:35:41,308
they make one big map,

613
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,710
leading to the location where the knights hid

614
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:46,413
the precious wealth they took from constantinople

615
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,415
After they sacked and burnt it.

616
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:52,286
Those knights are our ancestors.

617
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:55,322
- What, so they worked for the seven royal families.

618
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:57,324
- Some of them did. Well, they needed us.

619
00:35:57,391 --> 00:36:00,360
- So the wesen fought for the royals?

620
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:03,197
- Yes, and the royals needed the grimms to control them,

621
00:36:03,263 --> 00:36:06,333
as they do now, but there was one thing in the treasure

622
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,501
the knights hid.

623
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:10,237
There was one thing that was more powerful

624
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:14, 41
than anything anyone had ever seen.

625
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:16,243
If the royal families got ahold of it,

626
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,414
they could control the world.

627
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,316
- Okay, so nothing really big.

628
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:24,251
I guess they hid this thing pretty well?

629
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:25,452
- Sure, yeah.

630
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,921
They made a map, they cut it into seven pieces,

631
00:36:27,988 --> 00:36:31,158
and they gave each Knight a key.

632
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:34,561
- What was so powerful? - I wish I knew.

633
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:37,965
This is the only page left of the diary.

634
00:36:38, 31 --> 00:36:41,368
Which was destroyed in the wesen wars of 1285.

635
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:43,270
- Okay, now I have a headache.

636
00:36:43,337 --> 00:36:46,974
- Nick...

637
00:36:47, 40 --> 00:36:48,342
they know you have the key.

638
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:50,410
- Who? - The royal families.

639
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:52,412
They're the only ones powerful enough

640
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:55,182
to send the mauvais dentes. My guess is,

641
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:59,419
they want the key and they want you dead.

642
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:02,256
- [chuckles] how would they know I have a key?

643
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:03,457
I haven't shown it to anyone.

644
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:06,593
- There must be somebody in Portland who knows.

645
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,228
I think we have to get to Kimura,

646
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:10,264
because he might give us the connection.

647
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,265
We need to talk to him.

648
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:12,599
- You cannot go to the precinct.

649
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,969
- No, but you can.

- I have information about the case you're working on.

657
00:37:58, 11 --> 00:38:01,281
The security guard's stolen pickup truck you're looking for

658
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:03,283
is at the lumber mill on st. Helen's road.

659
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:06, 19
- Who is this?

660
00:38:06, 86 --> 00:38:08,121
- A concerned citizen.

661
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:28,942
- there's the truck.
