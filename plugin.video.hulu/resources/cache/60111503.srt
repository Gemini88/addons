00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,268
- me too.

170
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,572
- Three bodies.

171
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,441
Two of them are the FBI agents you turned your case over to.

172
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,609
One of them's hanging in the other room.

173
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:43,977
- Do the feds know yet?

174
00:10:44, 44 --> 00:10:45,179
- I just made the call.

175
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,314
Wanted to see what we were dealing with first.

176
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,316
- No identity on the third vic.

177
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,384
Hopefully we can tag him with prints.

178
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,518
- Who found the bodies?

179
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,120
- One of our units saw the car,

180
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:55,122
thought it was abandoned, pulled in for a routine check.

181
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:58,125
Ran the plates. Car registered to the feds.

182
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,194
Did a walk-Through, found the festivities.

183
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,929
- doesn't appear to have any bullet wounds.

184
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03, 96
It all looks very physical.

185
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,499
- Looks like somebody chewed off her hand.

186
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,634
- Must have been a hell of a fight.

187
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,136
- I guess that's the John Doe.

188
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,672
- Yeah.

189
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14, 74
- How you feeling? - I'm okay.

190
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,543
- I hurt just looking at you.

191
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18, 11
- Feds are here.

192
00:11:18, 78 --> 00:11:20,247
- Captain.

193
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:21,982
Bring 'em up. - Copy that.

194
00:11:22, 49 --> 00:11:23,984
- You have a 9-Mil shell over here.

195
00:11:24, 51 --> 00:11:26,320
Somebody fired a shot.

196
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,329
- Probably one of the agents got off a shot.

197
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,597
- Are you taking evidence?

198
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,198
- No, just prints and photos.

199
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,666
Otherwise, we're staying out of the way.

200
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,335
- mark it.

201
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,403
- and where's agent Durwell?

202
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,607
- This way.

203
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:53,380
- You see something?

204
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,550
- No. Thought I did.

205
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:58,619
- Captain Renard?

206
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00, 87
- Yeah.

207
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,922
- Special agents lofthouse and kosloski.

208
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03, 56
- Detectives Burkhardt--

209
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,458
- You know what the hell happened here?

210
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,126
- We were kind of hoping you'd tell us.

211
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,628
- All we know is they were working a case

212
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,662
they took over from you.

213
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,963
- we gave 'em everything we had,

214
00:12:10, 30 --> 00:12:12, 32
and from that point on it was theirs.

215
00:12:12, 99 --> 00:12:13,233
Now, we secured the scene.

216
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,502
I assume you're bringing your own people?

217
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,271
- They're right behind us.

218
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,940
You can pull your men.

219
00:12:20,  7 --> 00:12:21,241
9-Millimeter? - Yeah.

220
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,443
- leave it.

221
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,681
- Special agent Kanigher is just over here.

222
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,518
- Guess we can go home.

223
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,354
- Yeah. I can use some rest.

224
00:12:37, 24 --> 00:12:40,260
- son of a bitch.

225
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,797
Son of a bitch.

226
00:12:46, 66 --> 00:12:47,201
How the hell did this happen?

227
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,276
- Let's see who she called last.

228
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,678
- I've got my car here,

229
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,213
so I'll meet you guys back at the precinct.

230
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,715
- Sounds good.

231
00:13:04, 17 --> 00:13:06,386
- Yeah, Burkhardt.

232
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,722
Hello?

233
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12, 52
- I'm really sorry that took so long.

234
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:16,256
I've...never seen the Freemont bridge closed before.

235
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,136
- Thanks for the ride.

236
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,437
- Any time.

237
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:32,573
- You know, your son told Juliette

238
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,610
everything about...

239
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,378
what it's like to be, you know,

240
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,314
what you both are.

241
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,982
The night that she was infected,

242
00:14:42, 49 --> 00:14:44,451
Nick brought her to Monroe so he could convince her

243
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,153
that Nick was telling the truth.

244
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,321
- Without any warning, I might add.

245
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49, 22
- But you know what he was asking him to do.

246
00:14:49, 89 --> 00:14:51,124
- Boy, howdy. - and he was ready to do it.

247
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,326
- Not right off the bat,

248
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,997
but, you know,

249
00:14:57, 64 --> 00:14:59,433
desperate circumstances require...

250
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,235
- You know, this relationship,

251
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,503
whatever you want to call it,

252
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04, 71
between the two of you and Nick

253
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,239
doesn't make sense to me.

254
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,307
- to be honest, it doesn't really make sense

255
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,642
to us either.

256
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,378
- But why does it have to?

257
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,682
- I'm beginning to think it doesn't.

258
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,277
- was that a smile?

259
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,145
'cause I think that might have been a smile.

260
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,247
- Oh, that was a smile.

261
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,516
- You sure? - I have no idea.

262
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,552
- No, I think it might have been.

263
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55, 88
[background chatter, telephones ringing]

264
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,259
- We got a match.

265
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,460
- on the John Doe?

266
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:03, 30
- Yeah.

267
00:16:03, 96 --> 00:16:05,432
The prints match the prints we found on the ship,

268
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:07,167
but no I.D. Yet.

269
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,302
- What the hell did this?

270
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,537
- Something out of my worst nightmare.

271
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:13,207
- So our killer goes and gets himself killed,

272
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,441
saving the taxpayers some money.

273
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,176
How thoughtful.

274
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,511
- Let's bring it to the captain.

275
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,146
- and then let's get the hell out of here.

276
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,648
- We don't have an I.D. To match the prints yet,

277
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,283
but, since the ship was registered in rotterdam,

278
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,219
we sent a request over to interpol.

279
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,687
- Hopefully, we'll have an answer tomorrow.

280
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,488
- So we tied up the murders on the ship.

281
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30, 90
- Yeah, looks like.

282
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31, 91
- The two agents must have tracked him down.

283
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,192
They were looking to bring him in,

284
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,293
he was looking for a way out,

285
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,528
things went bad fast.

286
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,430
- You think he killed both agents?

287
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,464
- Yeah.

288
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:38,632
- Have you ruled out anyone else?

289
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,567
- You think there was someone else?

290
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,503
- That's what my gut tells me.

291
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,238
- Why?

292
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,639
- 'cause our killer had time to change clothes

293
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:47,174
with one of the agents.

294
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,175
You might do that if you're expecting someone else

295
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:49,176
to show up.

296
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,377
- You might do that

297
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,145
if you want to get away in different clothes.

298
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,715
- Well, it's in the hands of the feds now,

299
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,383
and I don't think they're dying for our help.

300
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,152
- No, they are not.

301
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,587
- Here, put this with our other files

302
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:03,190
and try to get some sleep.

303
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,962
- glad to see we're not the only ones

304
00:17:09, 29 --> 00:17:10,197
working late.

305
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:11,965
- You need something?

306
00:17:12, 32 --> 00:17:13,967
- Just a quick explanation. - What about?

307
00:17:14, 34 --> 00:17:15, 35
- We found agent Kanigher's phone.

308
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,336
- and we checked her last call,

309
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18, 38
made at 4:52 P.M.

310
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,107
It was to detective Burkhardt's cell phone.

311
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:21,441
- It lasted 27 seconds.

312
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,510
- Yeah. She called me.

313
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,312
She wanted more information

314
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,147
about what we found at the shipyard

315
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,282
in the cargo container.

316
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,983
- What did you tell her?

317
00:17:30, 50 --> 00:17:31,552
- I told her we gave her everything we had.

318
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,120
- That was all?

319
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:34,588
- You think there was more in 27 seconds?

320
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,690
- Did she tell you where she was

321
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:38,225
or where she was going?

322
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,127
- Would that be standard procedure for a special agent

323
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42, 29
in the FBI to tell a detective what she's doing?

324
00:17:42, 95 --> 00:17:43,664
- Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin just matched

325
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,232
the prints found in the cargo container

326
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,967
with those at the scene of your agents' death.

327
00:17:47, 34 --> 00:17:49,136
- You took prints from the scene?

328
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:50,938
- It may be your jurisdiction, but it's still in our city,

329
00:17:51,  4 --> 00:17:52,139
so, if we can help, we will,

330
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,674
whether you like it or not.

331
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,276
- You get an I.D.? - We're working on it.

332
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,445
- We think there was someone else involved.

333
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,180
- You have any evidence of that?

00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:21,668
- Oh, god, another Grimm.

500
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,203
What do you want?

501
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,172
- I'm a mother too.

502
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,976
What's wrong with Juliette?

503
00:28:29, 42 --> 00:28:31,578
- You're his mother.

504
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:34,248
- and I'm feeling very protective right now.

505
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:36, 49
- My daughter did this, not me.

506
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:37,918
- But you can fix it. - I'm not involved.

507
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:39,520
I had nothing to do with what she did.

508
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:41, 21
- You're her mother.

509
00:28:41, 88 --> 00:28:43,490
You taught her everything.

510
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,959
- Including when to keep her mouth shut.

511
00:28:46, 26 --> 00:28:47,294
- Now is not that time.

512
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:49,963
- You have no idea how high this goes.

513
00:28:50, 30 --> 00:28:51,365
- Heights don't scare me.

514
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:56,303
- There's a Prince.

515
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,971
- Where?

516
00:28:58, 38 --> 00:28:59,973
- Here. In Portland.

517
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,411
Stop.

I'm not much for the physical stuff.

520
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:14,621
- Tell me about this Prince.

521
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:19,560
- Well, he's handsome, charming, and a bastard.

522
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:21,395
And I mean that literally.

523
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:22,963
- Who is he?

524
00:29:23, 30 --> 00:29:23,897
- that, my dear, you'll have

525
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:26,667
to earn the hard way.

- You can't.

Only he can.

[sirens wail]

- You close a lot of cases, Burkhardt.

534
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:07, 67
To what would you attribute this great success?

535
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:08,702
- It's kind of an instinct, I guess.

536
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:10,170
- Yeah?

537
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:13, 40
I've got an instinct too.

538
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:15,709
Mine is telling me you were involved in this.

539
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:16,710
- You were there.

540
00:31:16,777 --> 00:31:19, 46
- You think I killed your agents?

541
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:20,113
- No.

542
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,949
We think you killed the other guy.

543
00:31:22, 15 --> 00:31:23,550
- Really?

544
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:26,687
- Somebody did. And it keeps coming back to you.

545
00:31:26,753 --> 00:31:28,589
- We've got a shell casing at the crime scene,

546
00:31:28,655 --> 00:31:32,259
and our agents' guns don't match it.

547
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:35,529
- You said you didn't wear your gun last night.

548
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:37,531
That was pretty convenient. That happen a lot?

549
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:40,100
- I was at the hospital visiting my girlfriend.

550
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,735
I didn't think a gun would be necessary.

551
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:45,205
- The last person Agent Kanigher called was you.

552
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:47,975
- if I could have saved her life, I would have.

553
00:31:48, 41 --> 00:31:50,444
And it wasn't my idea to turn the case over to them.

554
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:53,180
- Federal crime, our jurisdiction.

555
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56, 49
What did you know about it that you didn't tell them?

556
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:58,719
- All I know...

557
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:03,223
is whatever was in that shipping container

558
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,926
was more than they could handle.

559
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:08,262
- Why?

560
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:10,397
- It's instinct.

561
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:11,565
- Not good enough.

562
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:12,633
- It's all I have.

563
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:14,234
- and then there's the dna.

564
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:16,270
- if it was mine, I'd be in jail.

565
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:18,272
- The dna from a hair we found

566
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:20,574
is close enough to yours to be a relative.

567
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:24, 77
But it's not yours.

568
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:26,246
- We want to know who you're covering for.

569
00:32:28, 48 --> 00:32:29,316
- my mother.

570
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:32,152
- Funny.

571
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:37, 57
- Look, we have no interest in taking out a good cop.

572
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,625
But we have two dead agents.

573
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:41,562
- You're trying too hard.

574
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:44,665
This guy attacked your agents, and they went after him.

575
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:46,466
We have connected his fingerprints

576
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,701
to a dozen murders in Europe.

577
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:50,137
You've got your man.

00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:51,705
Trying to connect me to this case

579
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:53,674
is not gonna bring your agents back.

580
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,510
You should be giving them credit for the kill.

581
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10, 23
- Ballistics didn't match.

582
00:33:10, 90 --> 00:33:13, 26
But that doesn't mean I think this adds up.

583
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:22,703
- I don't care if it's federal. Pull a favor here.

584
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,204
I want Nick released.

I'll be there as soon as I can.

590
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,688
What the hell? You escape?

591
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:43,991
- They got their man, and they know it.

592
00:33:44, 57 --> 00:33:46,360
- Better get out of here before they change their mind.

593
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:50,964
We got a homicide in southwest.

594
00:33:51, 31 --> 00:33:52,666
- No forced entry.

595
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,735
There was a hell of a fight.

596
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:57,371
- We have a time frame?

597
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:58,739
- Neighbors reported the disturbance

598
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:00,440
about an hour and a half ago.

599

First patrol was on the scene within six minutes of the call.

- any I.D.?

601
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,147
- Her name's Catherine Schade.

602
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,950
Found her driver's license in her purse.

603
00:34:10, 17 --> 00:34:11,351
- Schade.

604
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:13, 53
That's Adalind's last name.

605
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,989
- Yeah.

606
00:34:16, 56 --> 00:34:18,525
- think she's related? - Guess we'll find out.

- What about Juliette?

623
00:36:27,754 --> 00:36:32, 59

Only he can.

I tried.

- Mom, the police are gonna get really close on this.

And I can't let you get caught up in it.

It's a long way.

There's still people looking for them.

But don't make the same mistake I did.

Don't leave the people you love.

All I have are a lot of regrets.

653
00:38:57,571 --> 00:39:00,440
- You don't owe anyone an apology.

654

- Yes, I do.

- What?
